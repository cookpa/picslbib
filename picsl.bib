  Abstract                 = {Few studies have examined connected speech in demented and non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We assessed the speech production of 35 patients with Lewy body spectrum disorder (LBSD), including non-demented PD patients, patients with PD dementia (PDD), and patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), in a semi-structured narrative speech sample in order to characterize impairments of speech fluency and to determine the factors contributing to reduced speech fluency in these patients. Both demented and non-demented PD patients exhibited reduced speech fluency, characterized by reduced overall speech rate and long pauses between sentences. Reduced speech rate in LBSD correlated with measures of between-utterance pauses, executive functioning, and grammatical comprehension. Regression analyses related non-fluent speech, grammatical difficulty, and executive difficulty to atrophy in frontal brain regions. These findings indicate that multiple factors contribute to slowed speech in LBSD, and this is mediated in part by disease in frontal brain regions.},

We performed a detailed analysis of a semi-structured speech sample in 32 non-aphasic patients with LBSD, and we related their narrative impairments to gray matter (GM) atrophy using voxel-based morphometry. We found that patients with PDD and DLB have significant difficulty organizing their narrative speech. This was correlated with deficits on measures of executive functioning and speech fluency. Regression analyses associated this deficit with reduced cortical volume in inferior frontal and anterior cingulate regions. These findings are consistent with a model of narrative discourse that includes executive as well as language components and with an impairment of the organizational component of narrative discourse in patients with PDD and DLB.},

  Abstract                 = {Converging lines of evidence suggest an adverse effect of heavy cannabis use on adolescent brain development, particularly on the hippocampus. In this preliminary study, we compared hippocampal morphology in 14 "treatment-seeking" adolescents (aged 18-20) with a history of prior heavy cannabis use (5.8 joints/day) after an average of 6.7 months of drug abstinence, and 14 demographically matched normal controls. Participants underwent a high-resolution 3D MRI as well as cognitive testing including the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Heavy-cannabis users showed significantly smaller volumes of the right (p < 0.04) and left (p < 0.02) hippocampus, but no significant differences in the amygdala region compared to controls. In controls, larger hippocampus volumes were observed to be significantly correlated with higher CVLT verbal learning and memory scores, but these relationships were not observed in cannabis users. In cannabis users, a smaller right hippocampus volume was correlated with a higher amount of cannabis use (r = -0.57, p < 0.03). These data support a hypothesis that heavy cannabis use may have an adverse effect on hippocampus development. These findings, after an average 6.7 month of supervised abstinence, lend support to a theory that cannabis use may impart long-term structural and functional damage. Alternatively, the observed hippocampal volumetric abnormalities may represent a risk factor for cannabis dependence. These data have potential significance for understanding the observed relationship between early cannabis exposure during adolescence and subsequent development of adult psychopathology reported in the literature for schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new algorithm for reliable, unbiased, multivariate longitudinal analysis of cortical and white matter atrophy rates with penalized statistical methods. The pipeline uses a step-wise approach to transform and personalize template information first to a single-subject template (SST) and then to the individual's time series data. The first stream of information flows from group template to the SST; the second flows from the SST to the individual time-points and provides unbiased, prior-based segmentation and measurement of cortical thickness. MRI-bias correction, consistent longitudinal segmentation, cortical parcellation and cortical thickness estimation are all based on strong use of the subject-specific priors built from initial diffeomorphic mapping between the SST and optimal group template. We evaluate our approach with both test-retest data and with application to a driving biological problem. We use test-retest data to show that this approach produces (a) zero change when the retest data contains the same image content as the test data and (b) produces normally distributed, low variance estimates of thickness change centered at zero when test-retest data is collected near in time to test data. We also show that our approach--when combined with sparse canonical correlation analysis--reveals plausible, significant, annualized decline in cortical thickness and white matter volume when contrasting frontotemporal dementia and normal aging.},

  Abstract                 = {We contribute a novel and interpretable dimensionality reduction strategy, eigenanatomy, that is tuned for neuroimaging data. The method approximates the eigendecomposition of an image set with basis functions (the eigenanatomy vectors) that are sparse, unsigned and are anatomically clustered. We employ the eigenanatomy vectors as anatomical predictors to improve detection power in morphometry. Standard voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyzes imaging data voxel-by-voxel--and follows this with cluster-based or voxel-wise multiple comparisons correction methods to determine significance. Eigenanatomy reverses the standard order of operations by first clustering the voxel data and then using standard linear regression in this reduced dimensionality space. As with traditional region-of-interest (ROI) analysis, this strategy can greatly improve detection power. Our results show that eigenanatomy provides a principled objective function that leads to localized, data-driven regions of interest. These regions improve our ability to quantify biologically plausible rates of cortical change in two distinct forms of neurodegeneration. We detail the algorithm and show experimental evidence of its efficacy.},

  Abstract                 = {Diffusion tensor (DT) and T1 structural magnetic resonance images provide unique and complementary tools for quantifying the living brain. We leverage both modalities in a diffeomorphic normalization method that unifies analysis of clinical datasets in a consistent and inherently multivariate (MV) statistical framework. We use this technique to study MV effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI).We contrast T1 and DT image-based measurements in the thalamus and hippocampus of 12 TBI survivors and nine matched controls normalized to a combined DT and T1 template space. The normalization method uses maps that are topology-preserving and unbiased. Normalization is based on the full tensor of information at each voxel and, simultaneously, the similarity between high-resolution features derived from T1 data. The technique is termed symmetric normalization for MV neuroanatomy (SyNMN). Voxel-wise MV statistics on the local volume and mean diffusion are assessed with Hotelling's T(2) test with correction for multiple comparisons.TBI significantly (false discovery rate P < .05) reduces volume and increases mean diffusion at coincident locations in the mediodorsal thalamus and anterior hippocampus.SyNMN reveals evidence that TBI compromises the limbic system. This TBI morphometry study and an additional performance evaluation contrasting SyNMN with other methods suggest that the DT component may aid normalization quality.},

  Abstract                 = {We use a new, unsupervised multivariate imaging and analysis strategy to identify related patterns of reduced white matter integrity, measured with the fractional anisotropy (FA) derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and decreases in cortical thickness, measured by high resolution T1-weighted imaging, in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This process is based on a novel computational model derived from sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) that allows us to automatically identify mutually predictive, distributed neuroanatomical regions from different imaging modalities. We apply the SCCA model to a dataset that includes 23 control subjects that are demographically matched to 49 subjects with autopsy or CSF-biomarker-diagnosed AD (n=24) and FTD (n=25) with both DTI and T1-weighted structural imaging. SCCA shows that the FTD-related frontal and temporal degeneration pattern is correlated across modalities with permutation corrected p<0.0005. In AD, we find significant association between cortical thinning and reduction in white matter integrity within a distributed parietal and temporal network (p<0.0005). Furthermore, we show that-within SCCA identified regions-significant differences exist between FTD and AD cortical-connective degeneration patterns. We validate these distinct, multimodal imaging patterns by showing unique relationships with cognitive measures in AD and FTD.

These multivariate datasets provide unique and often complementary anatomical and physiological information about the subject of interest. We present a method that uses fused multiple modality (scalar and tensor) datasets to perform intersubject spatial normalization. Our multivariate approach has the potential to eliminate inconsistencies that occur when normalization is performed on each modality separately. Furthermore, the multivariate approach uses a much richer anatomical and physiological image signature to infer image correspondences and perform multivariate statistical tests. In this initial study, we develop the theory for Multivariate Symmetric Normalization (MVSyN), establish its feasibility and discuss preliminary results on a multivariate statistical study of 22q deletion syndrome.},

  Abstract                 = {The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) commit significant support to open-source data and software resources in order to foment reproducibility in the biomedical imaging sciences. Here, we report and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669±0.022). Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal template construction and brain labeling.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce Atropos, an ITK-based multivariate n-class open source segmentation algorithm distributed with ANTs ( http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTs). The Bayesian formulation of the segmentation problem is solved using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm with the modeling of the class intensities based on either parametric or non-parametric finite mixtures. Atropos is capable of incorporating spatial prior probability maps (sparse), prior label maps and/or Markov Random Field (MRF) modeling. Atropos has also been efficiently implemented to handle large quantities of possible labelings (in the experimental section, we use up to 69 classes) with a minimal memory footprint. This work describes the technical and implementation aspects of Atropos and evaluates its performance on two different ground-truth datasets. First, we use the BrainWeb dataset from Montreal Neurological Institute to evaluate three-tissue segmentation performance via (1) K-means segmentation without use of template data; (2) MRF segmentation with initialization by prior probability maps derived from a group template; (3) Prior-based segmentation with use of spatial prior probability maps derived from a group template. We also evaluate Atropos performance by using spatial priors to drive a 69-class EM segmentation problem derived from the Hammers atlas from University College London. These evaluation studies, combined with illustrative examples that exercise Atropos options, demonstrate both performance and wide applicability of this new platform-independent open source segmentation tool.},

  Abstract                 = {Responses to acute stressors are determined in part by stress history. For example, a history of chronic stress results in facilitated responses to a novel stressor and this facilitation is considered to be adaptive. We previously demonstrated that repeated exposure of rats to the resident-intruder model of social stress results in the emergence of two subpopulations that are characterized by different coping responses to stress. The submissive subpopulation failed to show facilitation to a novel stressor and developed a passive strategy in the Porsolt forced swim test. Because a passive stress coping response has been implicated in the propensity to develop certain psychiatric disorders, understanding the unique circuitry engaged by exposure to a novel stressor in these subpopulations would advance our understanding of the etiology of stress-related pathology. An ex vivo functional imaging technique, manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI), was used to identify and distinguish brain regions that are differentially activated by an acute swim stress (15min) in rats with a history of social stress compared to controls. Specifically, Mn(2+) was administered intracerebroventricularly prior to swim stress and brains were later imaged ex vivo to reveal activated structures. When compared to controls, all rats with a history of social stress showed greater activation in specific striatal, hippocampal, hypothalamic, and midbrain regions. The submissive subpopulation of rats was further distinguished by significantly greater activation in amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and septum, suggesting that these regions may form a circuit mediating responses to novel stress in individuals that adopt passive coping strategies. The finding that different circuits are engaged by a novel stressor in the two subpopulations of rats exposed to social stress implicates a role for these circuits in determining individual strategies for responding to stressors. Finally, these data underscore the utility of ex vivo MEMRI to identify and distinguish circuits engaged in behavioral responses.},

First, a continuous diffusion tensor field is constructed from this discrete, noisy, measured DT-MRI data. Then a Frenet equation, describing the evolution of a fiber tract, was solved. This approach was validated using synthesized, noisy DT-MRI data. Corpus callosum and pyramidal tract trajectories were constructed and found to be consistent with known anatomy. The method's reliability, however, degrades where the distribution of fiber tract directions is nonuniform. Moreover, background noise in diffusion-weighted MRIs can cause a computed trajectory to hop from tract to tract. Still, this method can provide quantitative information with which to visualize and study connectivity and continuity of neural pathways in the central and peripheral nervous systems in vivo, and holds promise for elucidating architectural features in other fibrous tissues and ordered media.},

  Abstract                 = {Concepts bind together the features commonly associated with objects and events to form networks in long-term semantic memory. These conceptual networks are the basis of human knowledge and underlie perception, imagination, and the ability to communicate about experiences and the contents of the environment. Although it is often assumed that this distributed semantic information is integrated in higher-level heteromodal association cortices, open questions remain about the role and anatomic basis of heteromodal representations in semantic memory. Here we used combined neuroimaging evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to characterize the cortical networks underlying concept representation. Using a lexical decision task, we examined the processing of concepts in four semantic categories that varied on their sensory-motor feature associations (sight, sound, manipulation, and abstract). We found that the angular gyrus was activated across all categories regardless of their modality-specific feature associations, consistent with a heteromodal account for the angular gyrus. Exploratory analyses suggested that categories with weighted sensory-motor features additionally recruited modality-specific association cortices. Furthermore, DTI tractography identified white matter tracts connecting these regions of modality-specific functional activation with the angular gyrus. These findings are consistent with a distributed semantic network that includes a heteromodal, integrative component in the angular gyrus in combination with sensory-motor feature representations in modality-specific association cortices.},

If not all of the measurements can be completed, the quality of diffusion tensors fitted to the partial scan is sensitive to the order of the gradient directions in the scanner protocol. If the directions are in a random order, then a partial scan may cover some parts of the hemisphere densely but other parts sparsely and thus provide poor spherical coverage. We compare the results of ordering with previously published methods for optimizing the acquisition in simulation.Results show that all methods produce similar results and all improve the accuracy of the estimated diffusion tensors significantly over unordered acquisitions.The new ordering method improves the spherical coverage of partial scans and has the advantage of maintaining the optimal coverage of the complete scan.},

  Abstract                 = {Diffusion-tensor MRI can be used to measure fibre orientation within the brain. Several studies have proposed methods to reconstruct known white matter fibre tracts in the brain. These methods are known as tractography. However, the measured fibre orientations are subject to error, which leads tractography methods to fail or define false connections. Probabilistic tractography methods use a model of the probability density function (PDF) of the local fibre orientation in each voxel, to calculate the likelihood of any potential fibre pathway through a DT data set. We propose the Watson distribution as a new fibre orientation PDF to replace ad hoc models used previously. We compare the probabilistic index of connectivity (PICo) tractography method using three candidate PDFs and show that the Watson PDF compares favourably to the ad hoc models.},

A diffeomorphic registration based cortical thickness (DiReCT) measure is introduced where a continuous one-to-one correspondence between the gray matter-white matter interface and the estimated gray matter-cerebrospinal fluid interface is given by a diffeomorphic mapping in the image space. Thickness is then defined in terms of a distance measure between the interfaces of this sheet like structure. This technique also provides a natural way to compute continuous estimates of thickness within buried sulci by preventing opposing gray matter banks from intersecting. In addition, the proposed method incorporates neuroanatomical constraints on thickness values as part of the mapping process. Evaluation of this method is presented on synthetic images. As an application to brain images, a longitudinal study of thickness change in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum disorder is reported.},

  Abstract                 = {The hippocampal formation (HF) is a brain structure of great interest because of its central role in learning and memory, and its associated vulnerability to several neurological disorders. In vivo oblique coronal T2-weighted MRI with high in-plane resolution (0.5mm$\times$0.5mm), thick slices (2.0mm), and a field of view tailored to imaging the hippocampal formation (denoted HF-MRI in this paper) has been advanced as a useful imaging modality for detailed hippocampal morphometry. Cross-sectional analysis of volume measurements derived from HF-MRI has shown the modality's promise to yield sensitive imaging-based biomarker for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the utility of this modality for making measurements of longitudinal change has not yet been demonstrated. In this paper, using an unbiased deformation-based morphometry (DBM) pipeline, we examine the suitability of HF-MRI for estimating longitudinal change by comparing atrophy rates measured in the whole hippocampus from this modality with those measured from more common isotropic (1mm(3)) T1-weighted MRI in the same set of individuals, in a cohort of healthy controls and patients with cognitive impairment. While measurements obtained from HF-MRI were largely consistent with those obtained from T1-MRI, HF-MRI yielded slightly larger group effect of greater atrophy rates in patients than in controls. The estimated minimum sample size required for detecting a 25\% change in patients' atrophy rate in the hippocampus compared to the control group with a statistical power $\beta$=0.8 was N=269. For T1-MRI, the equivalent sample size was N=325. Using a dataset of test-retest scans, we show that the measurements were free of additive bias. We also demonstrate that these results were not a confound of certain methodological choices made in the DBM pipeline to address the challenges of making longitudinal measurements from HF-MRI, using a region of interest (ROI) around the HF to globally align serial images, followed by slice-by-slice deformable registration to measure local volume change. Additionally, we present a preliminary study of atrophy rate measurements within hippocampal subfields using HF-MRI. Cross-sectional differences in atrophy rates were detected in several subfields.},

  Abstract                 = {Psychophysical experiments are described that measure the sensitivity to motion features in point light displays of biological motion. Three motion features were investigated: the relative motion of the thighs, the relative motion of the thigh and leg, and the velocity profile of the leg. The perceptual threshold for discriminating a change in each motion feature was compared in upright and inverted point light displays. We find that subjects are more sensitive to two of the motion features in the upright display configuration (relative motion of thighs, relative motion of thigh and leg), but more sensitive to the third feature (velocity profile of the leg) in the inverted configuration. We propose that perceptual sensitivity to features used in biological motion perception should be greater in upright versus inverted displays. The results suggest that motion features differ in salience in biological motion perception.},

  Abstract                 = {iological motion recognition in point-light displays exhibits a well-known inversion effect (Grossman and Blake, 2001; Pavlova and Sokolov, 2000) analogous to inversion effects in other expert recognition systems like face recognition (Yin, 1969). We measured human observers' sensitivity to perturbations of intermediate level spatiotemporal features in point-light displays of upright and inverted walkers. We found that observers are more sensitive to perturbation of certain features in upright displays but more sensitive to other features in inverted displays. The features with greater sensitivity in upright displays describe the relative motion of adjacent limb segments (e.g., left thigh/right thigh, and thigh/leg). In contrast, perturbations to a feature that describes the angular velocity of the limbs result in greater sensitivity in inverted displays.
We hypothesize that certain intermediate level features are used by the visual system for biological motion recognition (Casile and Giese, 2005). Detection of these features may be orientation sensitive and therefore observers more sensitive to perturbations of these features in upright displays. On the other hand, if a feature is not used for recognition, the sensitivities may be the same under upright and inverted conditions, and may actually be higher in inverted displays because of greater impact of local attentional mechanisms in the absence of global high level integration.

  Abstract                 = {The hippocampus is a major structure of interest affected by temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Region of interest (ROI)-based analysis has traditionally been used to study hippocampal involvement in TLE, although spatial variation of structural and functional pathology have been known to exist within the ROI. In this article, structure-specific analysis (Yushkevich et al. (2007) Neuroimage 35:1516-1530) is applied to the study of both structure and function in TLE patients. This methodology takes into account information about the spatial correspondence of voxels within ROIs on left and right sides of the same subject as well as between subjects. Hippocampal thickness is studied as a measure of structural integrity, and functional activation in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment in which subjects performed a memory encoding task is studied as a measure of functional integrity. Pronounced disease-related decrease in thickness is found in posterior and anterior hippocampus. A region in the body also shows increased thickness in patients' healthy hippocampi compared with controls. Functional activation in diseased hippocampi is reduced in the body region compared to controls, whereas a region in the tail showing greater right-lateralized activation in controls also shows greater activation in healthy hippocampi compared with the diseased side in patients. Summary measurements generated by integrating quantities of interest over the entire hippocampus can also be used, as is done in conventional ROI analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {Pathology studies have shown that the anatomical subregions of the hippocampal formation are differentially affected in various neurological disorders, including temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Analysis of structure and function within these subregions using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to generate insights on disease associations as well as normative brain function. In this study, an atlas-based normalization method (Yushkevich et al., Neuroimage 44(2), 2009) was used to label hippocampal subregions, making it possible to examine subfield-level functional activation during an episodic memory task in two different cohorts of healthy controls and subjects diagnosed with intractable unilateral TLE. We report, for the first time, functional activation patterns within hippocampal subfields in TLE. We detected group differences in subfield activation between patients and controls as well as inter-hemispheric activation asymmetry within subfields in patients, with dentate gyrus (DG) and the anterior hippocampus region showing the greatest effects. DG was also found to be more active than CA1 in controls, but not in patients' epileptogenic side. These preliminary results will encourage further research on the utility of subfield-based biomarkers in TLE.},

  Abstract                 = {Pathology at preclinical and prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) may manifest itself as measurable functional change in neuronal networks earlier than detectable structural change. Functional connectivity as measured using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging has emerged as a useful tool for studying disease effects on baseline states of neuronal networks. In this study, we use high resolution MRI to label subregions within the medial temporal lobe (MTL), a site of early pathology in AD, and report an increase in functional connectivity in amnestic mild cognitive impairment between entorhinal cortex and subregions of the MTL, with the strongest effect in the anterior hippocampus. However, our data also replicated the effects of decreased connectivity of the MTL to other nodes of the default mode network reported by other researchers. This dissociation of changes in functional connectivity within the MTL versus the MTL's connection with other neocortical structures can help enrich the characterization of early stages of disease progression in AD},

  Notes                    = {(0) We describe a methodology for classification of gait (walk, run, jog, etc.) and recognition of individuals based on gait using two successive stages of principal component analysis (PCA) on kinematic data. In psychophysical studies, we have found that observers are sensitive to specific "motion features" that characterize human gait. These spatiotemporal motion features closely correspond to the first few principal components (PC) of the kinematic data. The first few PCs provide a representation of an individual gait as trajectory along a low-dimensional manifold in PC space. A second stage of PCA captures variability in the shape of this manifold across individuals or gaits. This simple eigenspace based analysis is capable of accurate classification across subjects.},

stages of principal component analysis (PCA) on kinematic data. The first stage of PCA provides a
low dimensional representation of gait. Components of this representation closely correspond to
particular spatiotemporal features of gait that we have shown to be important for visual recognition
of gait in a separate psychophysical study. A second stage of PCA captures the shape of the
trajectory within the low dimensional space during a given gait cycle across different individuals or
gaits. The projection space of the second stage of PCA has distinguishable clusters corresponding
to the individual identity and type of gait. Despite the simple eigen-analysis based approach,
promising recognition performance is obtained.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a long history and a growing interest in the canine as a subject of study in neuroscience research and in translational neurology. In the last few years, anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of awake and anesthetized dogs have been reported. Such efforts can be enhanced by a population atlas of canine brain anatomy to implement group analyses. Here we present a canine brain atlas derived as the diffeomorphic average of a population of fifteen mesaticephalic dogs. The atlas includes: 1) A brain template derived from in-vivo, T1-weighted imaging at 1 mm isotropic resolution at 3 Tesla (with and without the soft tissues of the head); 2) A co-registered, high-resolution (0.33 mm isotropic) template created from imaging of ex-vivo brains at 7 Tesla; 3) A surface representation of the gray matter/white matter boundary of the high-resolution atlas (including labeling of gyral and sulcal features). The properties of the atlas are considered in relation to historical nomenclature and the evolutionary taxonomy of the Canini tribe. The atlas is available for download (https://cfn.upenn.edu/aguirre/wiki/public:data_plosone_2012_datta).},

Informed consent was obtained before inclusion in the study. All patients with single short seizures were scanned immediately after EEG-documented seizures (between 45 and 150 min); one of two patients in status was scanned 14 h after cessation of seizures. DWI results were analyzed visually and by calculating apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps.We found significant decreases in ADC postictally in one of six patients with TLE due to HS and single short seizures. One patient with an incompletely resected temporal lobe tumor also exhibited ADC abnormalities. One patient in focal status epilepticus revealed a decrease in ADC, and one patient with a continuous aura had no DWI abnormality.Postictal DWI technique may occasionally help delineate epileptic areas in some patients with TLE. Yield is low in patients with HS and single short seizures: it may be higher in patients with tumor or status epilepticus.},

  Abstract                 = {Detailed knowledge of the anatomy and connectivity pattern of cortico-basal ganglia circuits is essential to an understanding of abnormal cortical function and pathophysiology associated with a wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. We aim to study the spatial extent and topography of human basal ganglia connectivity in vivo. Additionally, we explore at an anatomical level the hypothesis of coexistent segregated and integrative cortico-basal ganglia loops. We use probabilistic tractography on magnetic resonance diffusion weighted imaging data to segment basal ganglia and thalamus in 30 healthy subjects based on their cortical and subcortical projections. We introduce a novel method to define voxel-based connectivity profiles that allow representation of projections from a source to more than one target region. Using this method, we localize specific relay nuclei within predefined functional circuits. We find strong correlation between tractography-based basal ganglia parcellation and anatomical data from previously reported invasive tracing studies in nonhuman primates. Additionally, we show in vivo the anatomical basis of segregated loops and the extent of their overlap in prefrontal, premotor, and motor networks. Our findings in healthy humans support the notion that probabilistic diffusion tractography can be used to parcellate subcortical gray matter structures on the basis of their connectivity patterns. The coexistence of clearly segregated and also overlapping connections from cortical sites to basal ganglia subregions is a neuroanatomical correlate of both parallel and integrative networks within them. We believe that this method can be used to examine pathophysiological concepts in a number of basal ganglia-related disorders.},

Structural connectivity was measured by averaging fractional anisotropy (FA) over a geometric fiber bundle model that projects local white matter properties onto a centerline. In the uncinate fasciculus FA was found to predict performance on a measure of decision-making regarding homonym meaning. Functional synchronization of BOLD fMRI signals between frontal and temporal regions connected by the uncinate fasciculus was also found to predict the performance measure. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that combining equidimensional measures of functional and structural connectivity identified the network components that most significantly predict performance.},

We focus on script comprehension in patients with Lewy body spectrum disorders. While scripts unfold sequentially, constituent events are thought to contain an internal organization. Executive dysfunction in patients with Lewy body spectrum disorders may interfere with comprehension of this internal structure. We examined 42 patients (30 non-demented PD and 12 mildly demented PDD/DLB patients) and 12 healthy seniors. We presented 22 scripts (e.g., "going fishing"), each consisting of six events. Pilot data from young controls provided the basis for organizing associated events into clusters and arranging them hierarchically into scripts. We measured accuracy and latency to judge the order of adjacent events in the same cluster versus adjacent events in different clusters. PDD/DLB patients were less accurate in their ordering judgments than PD patients and controls. Healthy seniors and PD patients were significantly faster to judge correctly the order of highly associated within-cluster event pairs relative to less closely associated different-cluster event pairs, while PDD/DLB patients did not consistently distinguish between these event-pair types. This relative insensitivity to the clustered-hierarchical organization of events was related to executive impairment and to frontal atrophy as measured by volumetric MRI. These findings extend prior work on script processing to patients with Lewy body spectrum disorders and highlight the potential impact of frontal/executive dysfunction on the daily lives of affected patients.},

  Abstract                 = {Prior work has related sentence processing to executive deficits in non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We extended this investigation to patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and PD dementia (PDD) by examining grammatical and working memory components of sentence processing in the full range of patients with Lewy body spectrum disorder (LBSD). Thirty-three patients with LBSD were given a two-alternative, forced-choice sentence-picture matching task. Sentence type, working memory, and grammatical structure were systematically manipulated in the sentences. We found that patients with PDD and DLB were significantly impaired relative to non-demented PD patients and healthy controls. The deficit in PDD/DLB was most pronounced for sentences lengthened by the strategic placement of an additional prepositional phrase and for sentences with an additional proposition due to a center-embedded clause. However, there was no effect for subject-relative versus object-relative grammatical structure. An MRI voxel-based morphometry analysis in a subset of patients showed significant gray matter thinning in the frontal lobe bilaterally, and this extended to temporal, parietal and occipital regions. A regression analysis related sentence processing difficulty in LBSD to frontal neocortex, including inferior prefrontal, premotor, and dorsolateral prefrontal regions, as well as right superior temporal cortex. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that patients with PDD and DLB have difficulty processing sentences with increased working memory demands and that this deficit is related in part to their frontal disease.},

We examined executive control during sentence processing in LBSD by assessing temporary structural ambiguities. Using an on-line word detection procedure, patients heard sentences with a syntactic structure that has high-compatibility or low-compatibility with the main verb's statistically preferred syntactic structure, and half of the sentences were lengthened strategically between the onset of the ambiguity and its resolution. We found selectively slowed processing of lengthened ambiguous sentences in the PDD/DLB subgroup. This correlated with impairments on measures of executive control. Regression analyses related the working memory deficit during ambiguous sentence processing to significant cortical thinning in frontal and parietal regions. These findings emphasize the role of prefrontal disease in the executive limitations that interfere with processing ambiguous sentences in LBSD.},

C9P had more rapid progression than C9N: C9P ALS cases had a shortened survival (2.6±0.3 years) compared to C9N ALS (3.8±0.4 years; log-rank λ2=4.183, p=0.041), and C9P FTLD showed a significantly greater annualised rate of decline in letter fluency (4.5±1.3 words/year) than C9N FTLD (1.4±0.8 words/year, p=0.023). VBM revealed greater atrophy in the right frontoinsular, thalamus, cerebellum and bilateral parietal regions for C9P FTLD relative to C9N FTLD, and regression analysis related verbal fluency scores to atrophy in frontal and parietal regions. Neuropathological analysis found greater neuronal loss in the mid-frontal cortex in C9P FTLD, and mid-frontal cortex TDP-43 inclusion severity correlated with poor letter fluency performance.C9P cases may have a shorter survival in ALS and more rapid rate of cognitive decline related to frontal and parietal disease in FTLD. C9orf72 genotyping may provide useful prognostic and diagnostic clinical information for patients with ALS and FTLD.},

  Abstract                 = {To evaluate the longitudinal repeatability and accuracy of cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements by using pseudo-continuous arterial spin-labeled (pCASL) perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in typically developing children.Institutional review board approval with HIPAA compliance and informed consent were obtained. Twenty-two children aged 7-17 years underwent repeated pCASL examinations 2-4 weeks apart with a 3-T MR imager, along with in vivo blood T1 and arterial transit time measurements. Phase-contrast (PC) MR imaging was performed as the reference standard for global blood flow volume. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and within-subject coefficient of variation (wsCV) were used to evaluate accuracy and repeatability.The accuracy of pCASL against the reference standard of PC MR imaging increased on incorporating subjectwise in vivo blood T1 measurement (ICC: 0.32 vs 0.58). The ICC further increased to 0.65 by using a population-based model of blood T1. Additionally, CBF measurements with use of pCASL demonstrated a moderate to good level of longitudinal repeatability in whole brain (ICC = 0.61, wsCV = 15\%), in gray matter (ICC = 0.65, wsCV = 14\%), and across 16 brain regions (mean ICC = 0.55, wsCV = 17\%). The mean arterial transit time was 1538 msec ± 123 (standard deviation) in the pediatric cohort studied, which showed an increasing trend with age (P = .043).Incorporating developmental changes in blood T1 is important for improving the accuracy of pCASL CBF measurements in children and adolescents; the noninvasive nature, accuracy, and longitudinal repeatability should facilitate the use of pCASL perfusion MR imaging in neurodevelopmental studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Huntington's disease is caused by a known genetic mutation and so potentially can be diagnosed many years before the onset of symptoms. Neuropathological changes have been found in both striatum and frontal cortex in the pre-symptomatic stage. Disruption of cortico-striatal white matter fibre tracts is therefore likely to contribute to the first clinical signs of the disease. We analysed diffusion tensor MR image (DTI) data from 25 pre-symptomatic gene carriers (PSCs) and 20 matched controls using a multivariate support vector machine to identify patterns of changes in fractional anisotropy (FA). In addition, we performed probabilistic fibre tracking to detect changes in 'streamlines' connecting frontal cortex to striatum. We found a pattern of structural brain changes that includes putamen bilaterally as well as anterior parts of the corpus callosum. This pattern was sufficiently specific to enable us to correctly classify 82\% of scans as coming from a PSC or control subject. Fibre tracking revealed a reduction of frontal cortico-fugal streamlines reaching the body of the caudate in PSCs compared to controls. In the left hemispheres of PSCs we found a negative correlation between years to estimated disease onset and streamlines from frontal cortex to body of caudate. A large proportion of the fibres to the caudate body originate from the frontal eye fields, which play an important role in the control of voluntary saccades. This type of saccade is specifically impaired in PSCs and is an early clinical sign of motor abnormalities. A correlation analysis in 14 PSCs revealed that subjects with greater impairment of voluntary-guided saccades had fewer fibre tracking streamlines connecting the frontal cortex and caudate body. Our findings suggest a specific patho-physiological basis for these symptoms by indicating selective vulnerability of the associated white matter tracts.},

We describe a simple cortical network capable of recognizing event sequences through a process of encoding followed by detection. The network is composed of regular spiking and fast spiking neurons, with minimal connectivity. Ordered sequences of inputs occurring over tens-to-hundreds of milliseconds, are time compressed by the network into tightly clustered spike outputs occurring over a few milliseconds. We investigate the ability of the network to accurately encode the input pattern, in the presence or absence of noise. We show that information about relative input timings are preserved in the output interspike intervals.},

  Abstract                 = {Susceptometry-based MR oximetry has previously been shown suitable for quantifying hemoglobin oxygen saturation in large vessels for studying vascular reactivity and quantification of global cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen utilization. A key assumption underlying this method is that large vessels can be modeled as long paramagnetic cylinders. However, bifurcations, tapering, noncircular cross-section, and curvature of these vessels produce substantial deviations from cylindrical geometry, which may lead to errors in hemoglobin oxygen saturation quantification. Here, the accuracy of the "long cylinder" approximation is evaluated via numerical computation of the induced magnetic field from 3D segmented renditions of three veins of interest (superior sagittal sinus, femoral and jugular vein). At a typical venous oxygen saturation of 65\%, the absolute error in hemoglobin oxygen saturation estimated via a closed-form cylinder approximation was 2.6\% hemoglobin oxygen saturation averaged over three locations in the three veins studied and did not exceed 5\% for vessel tilt angles <30° at any one location. In conclusion, the simulation results provide a significant level of confidence for the validity of the cylinder approximation underlying MR susceptometry-based oximetry of large vessels.},

  Abstract                 = {Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is most commonly associated with TAR-DNA binding protein (TDP-43) or tau pathology at autopsy, but there are no in vivo biomarkers reliably discriminating between sporadic cases. As disease-modifying treatments emerge, it is critical to accurately identify underlying pathology in living patients so that they can be entered into appropriate etiology-directed clinical trials. Patients with tau inclusions (FTLD-TAU) appear to have relatively greater white matter (WM) disease at autopsy than those patients with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP). In this paper, we investigate the ability of white matter (WM) imaging to help discriminate between FTLD-TAU and FTLD-TDP during life using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).Patients with autopsy-confirmed disease or a genetic mutation consistent with FTLD-TDP or FTLD-TAU underwent multimodal T1 volumetric MRI and diffusion weighted imaging scans. We quantified cortical thickness in GM and fractional anisotropy (FA) in WM. We performed Eigenanatomy, a statistically robust dimensionality reduction algorithm, and used leave-one-out cross-validation to predict underlying pathology. Neuropathological assessment of GM and WM disease burden was performed in the autopsy-cases to confirm our findings of an ante-mortem GM and WM dissociation in the neuroimaging cohort.ROC curve analyses evaluated classification accuracy in individual patients and revealed 96\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity for WM analyses. FTLD-TAU had significantly more WM degeneration and inclusion severity at autopsy relative to FTLD-TDP.These neuroimaging and neuropathological investigations provide converging evidence for greater WM burden associated with FTLD-TAU, and emphasise the role of WM neuroimaging for in vivo discrimination between FTLD-TAU and FTLD-TDP.},

  Abstract                 = {The measurement of hippocampal volumes using MRI is a useful in-vivo biomarker for detection and monitoring of early Alzheimer's disease (AD), including during the amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI) stage. The pathology underlying AD has regionally selective effects within the hippocampus. As such, we predict that hippocampal subfields are more sensitive in discriminating prodromal AD (i.e., a-MCI) from cognitively normal controls than whole hippocampal volumes, and attempt to demonstrate this using a semi-automatic method that can accurately segment hippocampal subfields. High-resolution coronal-oblique T2-weighted images of the hippocampal formation were acquired in 45 subjects (28 controls and 17 a-MCI (mean age: 69.5 9.2; 70.2 7.6)). CA1, CA2, CA3, and CA4/DG subfields, along with head and tail regions, were segmented using an automatic algorithm. CA1 and CA4/DG segmentations were manually edited. Whole hippocampal volumes were obtained from the subjects' T1-weighted anatomical images. Automatic segmentation produced significant group differences in the following subfields: CA1 (left: p = 0.001, right: p = 0.038), CA4/DG (left: p = 0.002, right: p = 0.043), head (left: p = 0.018, right: p = 0.002), and tail (left: p = 0.019). After manual correction, differences were increased in CA1 (left: p < 0.001, right: p = 0.002), and reduced in CA4/DG (left: p = 0.029, right: p = 0.221). Whole hippocampal volumes significantly differed bilaterally (left: p = 0.028, right: p = 0.009). This pattern of atrophy in a-MCI is consistent with the topography of AD pathology observed in postmortem studies, and corrected left CA1 provided stronger discrimination than whole hippocampal volume (p = 0.03). These results suggest that semi-automatic segmentation of hippocampal subfields is efficient and may provide additional sensitivity beyond whole hippocampal volumes},

  Abstract                 = {Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging is widely used to study the structure of the fiber pathways of brain white matter. However, the diffusion tensor cannot capture complex intravoxel fiber architecture such as fiber crossings of bifurcations. Consequently, a number of methods have been proposed to recover intravoxel fiber bundle orientations from high angular resolution diffusion imaging scans, optimized to resolve fiber crossings. It is important to improve the brain tractography by applying these multifiber methods to diffusion tensor protocols with a clinical b- value (low), which are optimized on computing tensor scalar statistics. In order to characterize the variance among different methods, consequently to be able to select the most appropriate one for a particular application, it is desirable to compare them under identical experimental conditions.In this work, the authors study how QBall, spherical deconvolution, persistent angular structure, stick and ball, diffusion basis functions, and analytical QBall methods perform under clinically-realistic scanning conditions, where the b-value is typically lower (around 1000 s∕mm(2)), and the number of diffusion encoding orientations is fewer (30-60) than in dedicated high angular resolution diffusion imaging scans. To characterize the performance of the methods, they consider the accuracy of the estimated number of fibers, the relative contribution of each fiber population to the total magnetic resonance signal, and the recovered orientation error for each fiber bundle. To this aim, they use four different sources of data: synthetic data from Gaussian mixture model, cylinder restricted model, and in vivo data from two different acquisition schemes.Results of their experiments indicate that: (a) it is feasible to apply only a subset of these methods to clinical data sets and (b) it allows one to characterize the performance of each method. In particular, two methods are not feasible to the kind of magnetic resonance diffusion data they test. By the characterization of their systematic behavior, among other conclusions, they report the method which better performs for the estimation of the number of diffusion peaks per voxel, also the method which better estimates the diffusion orientation.The framework they propose for comparison allows one to effectively characterize and compare the performance of the most frequently used multifiber algorithms under realistic medical settings and realistic signal-to-noise ratio environments. The framework is based on several crossings with a non-orientational bias and different signal models. The results they present are relevant for medical doctors and researchers, interested in the use of the multifiber solution for tractography.},

  Abstract                 = {Brain atrophy is a relevant surrogate marker of the disease process in multiple sclerosis (MS) because it represents the net effect of various pathological processes leading to brain tissue loss. There are various approaches to quantifying central nervous system atrophy in MS. We have focused on a normalized measure of whole brain atrophy, the brain parenchymal fraction (BPF). BPF is defined as the brain parenchymal volume, divided by the volume within the surface of the brain. We applied this method to an MRI data set generated during a phase III clinical trial of interferon beta-1a (AVONEX). The purpose of the current study is to further explore clinical and MRI correlates of the BPF, particularly as they relate to relapse rate and Kurtzke's Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS); and to further explore the therapeutic effects observed in interferon beta-1a recipients. Of all demographic and disease measures in the clinical trial data base, T2 lesion volume most closely correlated with BPF in cross sectional studies, and was the baseline factor most closely correlated with progressive brain atrophy in the subsequent 2 years. We also observed that change in T2 lesion volume was the disease measure most closely correlated with change in BPF during 2 years of observation. Of interest, relapse number and EDSS change during 2 years were only weakly correlated with BPF change during the same period. Disability progression, defined as sustained worsening of at least 1.0 EDSS points from baseline, persisting at least 6 months, was associated with significantly greater brain atrophy progression. We observed a therapeutic effect of interferon beta-1a in the second year of the clinical trial, and this beneficial effect was not accounted for by change in gadolinium enhanced lesion volume, or by corticosteroid medication within 40 days of the final MRI scan. The BPF is an informative surrogate marker for destructive pathological processes in relaping MS patients, and is useful in demonstrating treatment effects in controlled clinical trials. The significance of progressive brain atrophy during relapsing MS will be assessed by measuring clinical and MRI changes in prospective follow up studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) provides data concerning water diffusion in the spinal cord, from which white matter tracts may be inferred, and connectivity between spinal cord segments may be determined. We evaluated this potential application by imaging spinal cords from normal adult rats and rats that received cervical lateral funiculotomies, disrupting the rubrospinal tract (RST). Vitrogen and fibroblasts were transplanted into the surgical lesion at time of injury in order to fill the cavity. At 10 weeks, animals were sacrificed; the spinal cords were dissected out and then imaged in a 9.4-Tesla magnet. DTI tractography demonstrated the disruption of the rubrospinal tract axons while indicating which axon tracts were preserved. Additionally, DTI imaging could identify the orientation of glial processes in the gray matter adjacent to the site of injury. In the injured animals, reactive astrocytes in adjacent gray matter appeared to orient themselves perpendicular to white matter tracts. In summary, DTI identified not only white matter disruption following injury, but could distinguish the orientation of the accompanying glial scar.},

  Abstract                 = {This work shows that multi-fibre reconstruction techniques, such as Persistent Angular Structure (PAS) MRI or QBall Imaging, provide much more information than just discrete fibre orientations, which is all that previous tractography algorithms exploit from them. We show that the shapes of the peaks of the functions output by multiple-fibre reconstruction algorithms reflect the underlying distribution of fibres. Furthermore, we show how to exploit this extra information to improve Probabilistic Index of Connectivity (PICo) tractography. The method uses the Bingham distribution to model the uncertainty in fibre-orientation estimates obtained from peaks in the PAS or QBall Orientation Distribution Function (ODF). The Bingham model captures anisotropy in the uncertainty, allowing the method to track through fanning and bending structures, which previous methods do not recover reliably. We devise a new calibration procedure to construct a mapping from peak shape to Bingham parameters. We test the accuracy of the calibration using a bootstrap experiment. Finally, we show that exploiting the peak shape in this way can provide improved PICo tractography results.},

  Abstract                 = {The continuous medial representation (cm-rep) is an approach that makes it possible to model, normalize, and analyze anatomical structures on the basis of medial geometry. Having recently presented a partial differential equation (PDE)-based approach for 3-D cm-rep modeling [1], here we present an equivalent 2-D approach that involves solving an ordinary differential equation. This paper derives a closed form solution of this equation and shows how Pythagorean hodograph curves can be used to express the solution as a piecewise polynomial function, allowing efficient and robust medial modeling. The utility of the approach in medical image analysis is demonstrated by applying it to the problem of shape-based normalization of the midsagittal section of the corpus callosum. Using diffusion tensor tractography, we show that shape-based normalization aligns subregions of the corpus callosum, defined by connectivity, more accurately than normalization based on volumetric registration. Furthermore, shape-based normalization helps increase the statistical power of group analysis in an experiment where features derived from diffusion tensor tractography are compared between two cohorts.

  Abstract                 = {Recent discussions within the neuroimaging community have highlighted the problematic presence of selection bias in experimental design. Although initially centering on the selection of voxels during the course of fMRI studies, we demonstrate how this bias can potentially corrupt voxel-based analyses. For such studies, template-based registration plays a critical role in which a representative template serves as the normalized space for group alignment. A standard approach maps each subject's image to a representative template before performing statistical comparisons between different groups. We analytically demonstrate that in these scenarios the popular sum of squared difference (SSD) intensity metric, implicitly surrogating as a quantification of anatomical alignment, instead explicitly maximizes effect size-an experimental design flaw referred to as "circularity bias." We illustrate how this selection bias varies in strength with the similarity metric used during registration under the hypothesis that while SSD-related metrics, such as Demons, will manifest similar effects, other metrics which are not formulated based on absolute intensity differences will produce less of an effect. Consequently, given the variability in voxel-based analysis outcomes with similarity metric choice, we caution researchers specifically in the use of SSD and SSD-related measures where normalization and statistical analysis involve the same image set. Instead, we advocate a more cautious approach where normalization of the individual subject images to the reference space occurs through corresponding image sets which are independent of statistical testing. Alternatively, one can use similarity terms that are less sensitive to this bias. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We propose the substitution of a recently developed fast and robust B-spline approximation routine and a modified hierarchical optimization scheme for improved bias field correction over the original N3 algorithm. Similar to the N3 algorithm, we also make the source code, testing, and technical documentation of our contribution, which we denote as "N4ITK," available to the public through the Insight Toolkit of the National Institutes of Health.

Forty-eight normal pregnancies with a gestational age (GA) of 25 to 35 weeks were studied. A fetal total maturation score (fTMS) was developed by utilizing six subscores that evaluated cortical sulcation, myelination, and the germinal matrix and provided a single combined numerical value to be evaluated as a marker of brain maturity. The fTMS was correlated with GA and segmented brain volume. A regression model that associated GA based on the visual fTMS scoring was determined. The model was validated with a leave-one-out cross validation procedure.Mean GA was 29.3 weeks ± 2.9 (standard deviation) (range, 25.2-35.3 weeks) and mean fTMS was 8.6 ± 3.7 (range, 4-16). The intraclass correlation coefficient between the three readers (independent and blinded) was 0.948 (P < .001). The correlations were as follows: GA and brain volume, r = 0.964 (P < .001); fTMS and brain volume, r = 0.970 (P < .001); and GA and fTMS, r = 0.975 (P < .001). A regression model to calculate GA based on fTMS yielded the following equation: calculated GA (weeks) = 22.86 + 0.748 fTMS (P < .001; adjusted R(2) = 0.946). The standard error of the model for calculation of fetal GA from the visual fTMS scale was ± 4.8 days.If validated further, the fTMS scale might be used to assess morphologic brain maturity of fetuses between 25 and 35 weeks GA on a single-case basis in a clinical setting.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a simple but generally applicable approach to improving the accuracy of automatic image segmentation algorithms relative to manual segmentations. The ap- proach is based on the hypothesis that a large fraction of the errors produced by auto- matic segmentation are systematic, i.e., occur consistently from subject to subject, and serves as a wrapper method around a given host segmentation method. The wrapper method attempts to learn the intensity, spatial and contextual patterns associated with systematic segmentation errors produced by the host method on training data for which manual segmentations are available. The method then attempts to correct such errors in segmentations produced by the host method on new images. One practical use of the proposed wrapper method is to adapt existing segmentation tools, without explicit modification, to imaging data and segmentation protocols that are different from those on which the tools were trained and tuned. An open-source implementation of the proposed wrapper method is provided, and can be applied to a wide range of image segmentation problems. The wrapper method is evaluated with four host brain MRI segmentation methods: hippocampus segmentation using FreeSurfer (Fischl et al., 2002); hippocampus seg- mentation using multi-atlas label fusion (Artaechevarria et al., 2009); brain extraction using BET (Smith, 2002); and brain tissue segmentation using FAST (Zhang et al., 2001). The wrapper method generates 72\%, 14\%, 29\% and 21\% fewer erroneously segmented voxels than the respective host segmentation methods. In the hippocampus segmentation experiment with multi-atlas label fusion as the host method, the aver- age Dice overlap between reference segmentations and segmentations produced by the wrapper method is 0.908 for normal controls and 0.893 for patients with mild cognitive impairment. Average Dice overlaps of 0.964, 0.905 and 0.951 are obtained for brain extraction, white matter segmentation and gray matter segmentation, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {Automatic segmentation using multi-atlas label fusion has been widely applied in medical image analysis. To simplify the label fusion problem, most methods implicitly make a strong assumption that the segmentation errors produced by different atlases are uncorrelated. We show that violating this assumption significantly reduces the efficiency of multi-atlas segmentation. To address this problem, we propose a regression-based approach for label fusion. Our experiments on segmenting the hippocampus in magnetic resonance images (MRI) show significant improvement over previous label fusion techniques},

  Abstract                 = {Multi-atlas segmentation is an effective approach for automatically labeling objects of interest in biomedical images. In this approach, multiple expert-segmented example images, called \textbackslashemph\{atlases\}, are registered to a target image, and deformed atlas segmentations are combined using \textbackslashemph\{label fusion\}. Among the proposed label fusion strategies, weighted voting with spatially varying weight distributions derived from atlas-target intensity similarity have been particularly successful. However, one limitation of these strategies is that the weights are computed independently for each atlas, without taking into account the fact that different atlases may produce similar label errors. To address this limitation, we propose a new solution for the label fusion problem, in which weighted voting is formulated in terms of minimizing the total expectation of labeling error, and in which pairwise dependency between atlases is explicitly modeled as the joint probability of two atlases making a segmentation error at a voxel. This probability is approximated using intensity similarity between a pair of atlases and the target image in the neighborhood of each voxel. We validate our method in two medical image segmentation problems: hippocampus segmentation and hippocampus subfield segmentation in magnetic resonance (MR) images. For both problems, we show consistent and significant improvement over label fusion strategies that assign atlas weights independently},

Measures of CBF, in a predetermined set of regions (meta-ROI), and hippocampal volume were compared between CN (n=47), patients with early and late Mild Cognitive Impairment [EMCI (n=32), LMCI (n=35)], and AD (n=15). Associations between these measures and disease severity, assessed by Clinical Dementia Rating scale sum of boxes (CDR SB), were also assessed. Mean meta-ROI CBF was associated with group status and significant hypoperfusion was observed in LMCI and AD relative to CN. Hippocampal volume was associated with group status, but only AD patients had significantly smaller volumes than the CN. When examining the relationship between these measures and disease severity, both were significantly associated with CDR SB and appeared to provide independent prediction of status. In light of the tight link between CBF and metabolism, ASL MRI represents a promising functional biomarker for early diagnosis and disease tracking in AD and this study is the first to demonstrate the feasibility in a multi-site context in this population. Combining functional and structural measures, which can be acquired in the same scanning session, appears to provide additional information about disease severity relative to either measure alone},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a method for the recognition and prediction
of motion, based on the idea that different motions trace out
different shapes in some state space.
In the recognition step we use a multidimensional generalization
of the shape context [12] to find the closest prototype
motion to the observed data. When tested against motion
capture data, our model yields excellent (99\%) recognition
of gait and good (83\%) recognition of identity.
In addition to recognition, this process also allows us
to find an aligning transform TDP that maps the observed
data D onto the prototype P. Given this transform, and its
inverse TPD, we use a Bayesian approach to make optimal
predictions about the data in the prototype space and then
map these predictions back into data space. This approach
gives accurate predictions over several gait cycles despite
the fact that there is often a significant difference between
the observed data and the prototype manifold.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this work is to develop a new framework for multi-object segmentation of deep brain structures (caudate nucleus, putamen and thalamus) in medical brain images. Deep brain segmentation is difficult and challenging because the structures of interest are of relatively small size and have significant shape variations. The structure boundaries may be blurry or even missing, and the surrounding background is full of irrelevant edges. To tackle these problems, we propose a template-based framework to fuse the information of edge features, region statistics and inter-structure constraints for detecting and locating all target brain structures such that initialization by hand is unnecessary. The multi-object template is organized in the form of a hierarchical Markov dependence tree (MDT), and multiple objects are efficiently matched to a target image by a top-to-down optimization strategy. The final segmentation is obtained through refinement by a B-spline based non-rigid registration between the exemplar image and the target image. Our approach needs only one example as training data. We have validated the proposed method on a publicly available T1-weighted magnetic resonance image database with expert-segmented brain structures. In the experiments, the proposed approach has obtained encouraging results with 0.80 Dice score for the caudate nuclei, 0.81 Dice score for the putamina and 0.84 Dice score for the thalami on average.},

  Abstract                 = {Measurement of brain change due to neurodegenerative disease and treatment is one of the fundamental tasks of neuroimaging. Deformation-based morphometry (DBM) has been long recognized as an effective and sensitive tool for estimating the change in the volume of brain regions over time. This paper demonstrates that a straightforward application of DBM to estimate the change in the volume of the hippocampus can result in substantial bias, i.e., an overestimation of the rate of change in hippocampal volume. In ADNI data, this bias is manifested as a non-zero intercept of the regression line fitted to the 6 and 12 month rates of hippocampal atrophy. The bias is further confirmed by applying DBM to repeat scans of subjects acquired on the same day. This bias appears to be the result of asymmetry in the interpolation of baseline and followup images during longitudinal image registration. Correcting this asymmetry leads to bias-free atrophy estimation.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes the construction of a computational anatomical atlas of the human hippocampus. The atlas is derived from high-resolution 9.4 Tesla MRI of postmortem samples. The main subfields of the hippocampus (cornu ammonis fields CA1, CA2/3; the dentate gyrus; and the vestigial hippocampal sulcus) are labeled in the images manually using a combination of distinguishable image features and geometrical features. A synthetic average image is derived from the MRI of the samples using shape and intensity averaging in the diffeomorphic non-linear registration framework, and a consensus labeling of the template is generated. The agreement of the consensus labeling with manual labeling of each sample is measured, and the effect of aiding registration with landmarks and manually generated mask images is evaluated. The atlas is provided as an online resource with the aim of supporting subfield segmentation in emerging hippocampus imaging and image analysis techniques. An example application examining subfield-level hippocampal atrophy in temporal lobe epilepsy demonstrates the application of the atlas to in vivo studies.},

  Abstract                 = {We present and evaluate a new method for automatically labeling the subfields of the hippocampal formation in focal 0.4x0.5x2.0mm(3) resolution T2-weighted magnetic resonance images that can be acquired in the routine clinical setting with under 5min scan time. The method combines multi-atlas segmentation, similarity-weighted voting, and a novel learning-based bias correction technique to achieve excellent agreement with manual segmentation. Initial partitioning of MRI slices into hippocampal 'head', 'body' and 'tail' slices is the only input required from the user, necessitated by the nature of the underlying segmentation protocol. Dice overlap between manual and automatic segmentation is above 0.87 for the larger subfields, CA1 and dentate gyrus, and is competitive with the best results for whole-hippocampus segmentation in the literature. Intraclass correlation of volume measurements in CA1 and dentate gyrus is above 0.89. Overlap in smaller hippocampal subfields is lower in magnitude (0.54 for CA2, 0.62 for CA3, 0.77 for subiculum and 0.79 for entorhinal cortex) but comparable to overlap between manual segmentations by trained human raters. These results support the feasibility of subfield-specific hippocampal morphometry in clinical studies of memory and neurodegenerative disease.},

Existing techniques focus primarily on using diffusivity-based quantities derived from diffusion tensor as surrogate measures of microstructural tissue properties of white matter. In this paper, we describe a novel tract-specific framework that enables the examination of white matter morphometry at both the macroscopic and microscopic scales. The framework leverages the skeleton-based modeling of sheet-like white matter fasciculi using the continuous medial representation, which gives a natural definition of thickness and supports its comparison across subjects. The thickness measure provides a macroscopic characterization of white matter fasciculi that complements existing analysis of microstructural features. The utility of the framework is demonstrated in quantifying white matter atrophy in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, a severe neurodegenerative disease of motor neurons. We show that, compared to using microscopic features alone, combining the macroscopic and microscopic features gives a more complete characterization of the disease.},

The other contribution lies in the introduction of a reinforced self-similarities descriptor in characterizing the local appearance of landmarks. Theoretical analysis and a series of preliminary experimental results show both the effectiveness of our optimization scheme and the high differentiating ability of our features.},
