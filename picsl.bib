	reduced speech fluency, characterized by reduced overall speech rate
	and long pauses between sentences. Reduced speech rate in LBSD correlated
	with measures of between-utterance pauses, executive functioning,
	and grammatical comprehension. Regression analyses related non-fluent
	speech, grammatical difficulty, and executive difficulty to atrophy
	in frontal brain regions. These findings indicate that multiple factors

  abstract = {Converging lines of evidence suggest an adverse effect of heavy cannabis
	use on adolescent brain development, particularly on the hippocampus.
	In this preliminary study, we compared hippocampal morphology in
	14 "treatment-seeking" adolescents (aged 18-20) with a history of
	prior heavy cannabis use (5.8 joints/day) after an average of 6.7
	months of drug abstinence, and 14 demographically matched normal
	controls. Participants underwent a high-resolution 3D MRI as well
	as cognitive testing including the California Verbal Learning Test
	(CVLT). Heavy-cannabis users showed significantly smaller volumes
	of the right (p < 0.04) and left (p < 0.02) hippocampus, but no significant
	differences in the amygdala region compared to controls. In controls,
	larger hippocampus volumes were observed to be significantly correlated
	with higher CVLT verbal learning and memory scores, but these relationships
	were not observed in cannabis users. In cannabis users, a smaller
	right hippocampus volume was correlated with a higher amount of cannabis
	use (r = -0.57, p < 0.03). These data support a hypothesis that heavy
	cannabis use may have an adverse effect on hippocampus development.
	These findings, after an average 6.7 month of supervised abstinence,
	lend support to a theory that cannabis use may impart long-term structural
	and functional damage. Alternatively, the observed hippocampal volumetric
	abnormalities may represent a risk factor for cannabis dependence.
	These data have potential significance for understanding the observed
	relationship between early cannabis exposure during adolescence and
	subsequent development of adult psychopathology reported in the literature
	for schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.},

	from the SST to the individual time-points and provides unbiased,

	between the SST and optimal group template. We evaluate our approach
	with both test-retest data and with application to a driving biological
	problem. We use test-retest data to show that this approach produces
	(a) zero change when the retest data contains the same image content
	as the test data and (b) produces normally distributed, low variance
	estimates of thickness change centered at zero when test-retest data
	is collected near in time to test data. We also show that our approach--when

	The technique is termed symmetric normalization for MV neuroanatomy

  abstract = {We introduce Atropos, an ITK-based multivariate n-class open source
	segmentation algorithm distributed with ANTs ( http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTs).
	The Bayesian formulation of the segmentation problem is solved using
	the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm with the modeling of
	the class intensities based on either parametric or non-parametric
	finite mixtures. Atropos is capable of incorporating spatial prior
	probability maps (sparse), prior label maps and/or Markov Random
	Field (MRF) modeling. Atropos has also been efficiently implemented
	to handle large quantities of possible labelings (in the experimental
	section, we use up to 69 classes) with a minimal memory footprint.
	This work describes the technical and implementation aspects of Atropos
	and evaluates its performance on two different ground-truth datasets.
	First, we use the BrainWeb dataset from Montreal Neurological Institute
	to evaluate three-tissue segmentation performance via (1) K-means
	segmentation without use of template data; (2) MRF segmentation with
	initialization by prior probability maps derived from a group template;
	(3) Prior-based segmentation with use of spatial prior probability
	maps derived from a group template. We also evaluate Atropos performance
	by using spatial priors to drive a 69-class EM segmentation problem
	derived from the Hammers atlas from University College London. These
	evaluation studies, combined with illustrative examples that exercise
	Atropos options, demonstrate both performance and wide applicability
	of this new platform-independent open source segmentation tool.},

  journal = {{P}hysiol {B}ehav},

  abstract = {Responses to acute stressors are determined in part by stress history.
	For example, a history of chronic stress results in facilitated responses
	to a novel stressor and this facilitation is considered to be adaptive.
	We previously demonstrated that repeated exposure of rats to the
	resident-intruder model of social stress results in the emergence
	of two subpopulations that are characterized by different coping
	responses to stress. The submissive subpopulation failed to show
	facilitation to a novel stressor and developed a passive strategy
	in the Porsolt forced swim test. Because a passive stress coping
	response has been implicated in the propensity to develop certain
	psychiatric disorders, understanding the unique circuitry engaged
	by exposure to a novel stressor in these subpopulations would advance
	our understanding of the etiology of stress-related pathology. An
	ex vivo functional imaging technique, manganese-enhanced magnetic
	resonance imaging (MEMRI), was used to identify and distinguish brain
	regions that are differentially activated by an acute swim stress
	(15min) in rats with a history of social stress compared to controls.
	Specifically, Mn(2+) was administered intracerebroventricularly prior
	to swim stress and brains were later imaged ex vivo to reveal activated
	structures. When compared to controls, all rats with a history of
	social stress showed greater activation in specific striatal, hippocampal,
	hypothalamic, and midbrain regions. The submissive subpopulation
	of rats was further distinguished by significantly greater activation
	in amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and septum, suggesting
	that these regions may form a circuit mediating responses to novel
	stress in individuals that adopt passive coping strategies. The finding
	that different circuits are engaged by a novel stressor in the two
	subpopulations of rats exposed to social stress implicates a role
	for these circuits in determining individual strategies for responding
	to stressors. Finally, these data underscore the utility of ex vivo
	MEMRI to identify and distinguish circuits engaged in behavioral
	responses.},

	Using a lexical decision task, we examined the processing of concepts

	suggested that categories with weighted sensory-motor features additionally
	recruited modality-specific association cortices. Furthermore, DTI
	tractography identified white matter tracts connecting these regions

	These findings are consistent with a distributed semantic network

  abstract = {The hippocampal formation (HF) is a brain structure of great interest
	because of its central role in learning and memory, and its associated
	vulnerability to several neurological disorders. In vivo oblique
	coronal T2-weighted MRI with high in-plane resolution (0.5mm$\times$0.5mm),
	thick slices (2.0mm), and a field of view tailored to imaging the
	hippocampal formation (denoted HF-MRI in this paper) has been advanced
	as a useful imaging modality for detailed hippocampal morphometry.
	Cross-sectional analysis of volume measurements derived from HF-MRI
	has shown the modality's promise to yield sensitive imaging-based
	biomarker for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.
	However, the utility of this modality for making measurements of
	longitudinal change has not yet been demonstrated. In this paper,
	using an unbiased deformation-based morphometry (DBM) pipeline, we
	examine the suitability of HF-MRI for estimating longitudinal change
	by comparing atrophy rates measured in the whole hippocampus from
	this modality with those measured from more common isotropic (1mm(3))
	T1-weighted MRI in the same set of individuals, in a cohort of healthy
	controls and patients with cognitive impairment. While measurements
	obtained from HF-MRI were largely consistent with those obtained
	from T1-MRI, HF-MRI yielded slightly larger group effect of greater
	atrophy rates in patients than in controls. The estimated minimum
	sample size required for detecting a 25\% change in patients' atrophy
	rate in the hippocampus compared to the control group with a statistical
	power $\beta$=0.8 was N=269. For T1-MRI, the equivalent sample size
	was N=325. Using a dataset of test-retest scans, we show that the
	measurements were free of additive bias. We also demonstrate that
	these results were not a confound of certain methodological choices
	made in the DBM pipeline to address the challenges of making longitudinal
	measurements from HF-MRI, using a region of interest (ROI) around
	the HF to globally align serial images, followed by slice-by-slice
	deformable registration to measure local volume change. Additionally,
	we present a preliminary study of atrophy rate measurements within
	hippocampal subfields using HF-MRI. Cross-sectional differences in
	atrophy rates were detected in several subfields.},

  abstract = {iological motion recognition in point-light displays exhibits a well-known
	inversion effect (Grossman and Blake, 2001; Pavlova and Sokolov,
	2000) analogous to inversion effects in other expert recognition
	systems like face recognition (Yin, 1969). We measured human observers'
	sensitivity to perturbations of intermediate level spatiotemporal
	features in point-light displays of upright and inverted walkers.
	We found that observers are more sensitive to perturbation of certain
	features in upright displays but more sensitive to other features
	in inverted displays. The features with greater sensitivity in upright
	displays describe the relative motion of adjacent limb segments (e.g.,
	left thigh/right thigh, and thigh/leg). In contrast, perturbations
	to a feature that describes the angular velocity of the limbs result
	in greater sensitivity in inverted displays. We hypothesize that
	certain intermediate level features are used by the visual system
	for biological motion recognition (Casile and Giese, 2005). Detection
	of these features may be orientation sensitive and therefore observers
	more sensitive to perturbations of these features in upright displays.
	On the other hand, if a feature is not used for recognition, the
	sensitivities may be the same under upright and inverted conditions,
	and may actually be higher in inverted displays because of greater
	impact of local attentional mechanisms in the absence of global high
	level integration. We thank the Center for Human Modeling and Simulation

	sensitive to specific "motion features" that characterize human gait.
	These spatiotemporal motion features closely correspond to the first
	few principal components (PC) of the kinematic data. The first few
	PCs provide a representation of an individual gait as trajectory
	along a low-dimensional manifold in PC space. A second stage of PCA
	captures variability in the shape of this manifold across individuals
	or gaits. This simple eigenspace based analysis is capable of accurate

	tractography on magnetic resonance diffusion weighted imaging data
	to segment basal ganglia and thalamus in 30 healthy subjects based
	on their cortical and subcortical projections. We introduce a novel
	method to define voxel-based connectivity profiles that allow representation

	this method, we localize specific relay nuclei within predefined
	functional circuits. We find strong correlation between tractography-based
	basal ganglia parcellation and anatomical data from previously reported
	invasive tracing studies in nonhuman primates. Additionally, we show
	in vivo the anatomical basis of segregated loops and the extent of
	their overlap in prefrontal, premotor, and motor networks. Our findings
	in healthy humans support the notion that probabilistic diffusion
	tractography can be used to parcellate subcortical gray matter structures

  abstract = {Recent interest in human brain connectivity has led to the application
	of graph theoretical analysis to human brain structural networks,
	in particular white matter connectivity inferred from diffusion imaging
	and fiber tractography. While these methods have been used to study
	a variety of patient populations, there has been less examination
	of the reproducibility of these methods. A number of tractography
	algorithms exist and many of these are known to be sensitive to user-selected
	parameters. The methods used to derive a connectivity matrix from
	fiber tractography output may also influence the resulting graph
	metrics. Here we examine how these algorithm and parameter choices
	influence the reproducibility of proposed graph metrics on a publicly
	available test-retest dataset consisting of 21 healthy adults. The
	dice coefficient is used to examine topological similarity of constant
	density subgraphs both within and between subjects. Seven graph metrics
	are examined here: mean clustering coefficient, characteristic path
	length, largest connected component size, assortativity, global efficiency,
	local efficiency, and rich club coefficient. The reproducibility
	of these network summary measures is examined using the intraclass
	correlation coefficient (ICC). Graph curves are created by treating
	the graph metrics as functions of a parameter such as graph density.
	Functional data analysis techniques are used to examine differences
	in graph measures that result from the choice of fiber tracking algorithm.
	The graph metrics consistently showed good levels of reproducibility
	as measured with ICC, with the exception of some instability at low
	graph density levels. The global and local efficiency measures were
	the most robust to the choice of fiber tracking algorithm.},

	Lewy bodies (DLB). We focus on script comprehension in patients with
	Lewy body spectrum disorders. While scripts unfold sequentially,
	constituent events are thought to contain an internal organization.
	Executive dysfunction in patients with Lewy body spectrum disorders
	may interfere with comprehension of this internal structure. We examined
	42 patients (30 non-demented PD and 12 mildly demented PDD/DLB patients)
	and 12 healthy seniors. We presented 22 scripts (e.g., "going fishing"),
	each consisting of six events. Pilot data from young controls provided
	the basis for organizing associated events into clusters and arranging
	them hierarchically into scripts. We measured accuracy and latency
	to judge the order of adjacent events in the same cluster versus
	adjacent events in different clusters. PDD/DLB patients were less
	accurate in their ordering judgments than PD patients and controls.
	Healthy seniors and PD patients were significantly faster to judge
	correctly the order of highly associated within-cluster event pairs
	relative to less closely associated different-cluster event pairs,
	while PDD/DLB patients did not consistently distinguish between these
	event-pair types. This relative insensitivity to the clustered-hierarchical
	organization of events was related to executive impairment and to
	frontal atrophy as measured by volumetric MRI. These findings extend
	prior work on script processing to patients with Lewy body spectrum
	disorders and highlight the potential impact of frontal/executive
	dysfunction on the daily lives of affected patients.},

	components of sentence processing in the full range of patients with

	pronounced for sentences lengthened by the strategic placement of
	an additional prepositional phrase and for sentences with an additional
	proposition due to a center-embedded clause. However, there was no
	effect for subject-relative versus object-relative grammatical structure.
	An MRI voxel-based morphometry analysis in a subset of patients showed

	a comprehensive analysis technique to generate high-resolution 3D
	MV models and examine interoperator and intraoperator repeatability
	in humans.Patients with normal MVs were imaged using intraoperative
	transesophageal real-time 3D echocardiography. The annulus and leaflets
	were manually segmented using a TomTec Echo-View workstation. The
	resultant annular and leaflet point cloud was used to generate fully
	quantitative 3D MV models using custom Matlab algorithms. Eight images
	were subjected to analysis by two independent observers. Two sequential
	images were acquired for 6 patients and analyzed by the same observer.
	Each pair of annular tracings was compared with respect to conventional
	variables and by calculating the mean absolute distance between paired
	renderings. To compare leaflets, MV models were aligned so as to
	minimize their sum of squares difference, and their mean absolute
	difference was measured.Mean absolute annular and leaflet distance
	was 2.4±0.8 and 0.6±0.2 mm for the interobserver and 1.5±0.6 and
	0.5±0.2 mm for the intraobserver comparisons, respectively. There
	was less than 10\% variation in annular variables between comparisons.These
	techniques generate high-resolution, quantitative 3D models of the
	MV and can be used consistently to image the human MV with very small
	interoperator and intraoperator variability. These data lay the framework

	rotational template. The AV leaflets and the coaptation zone were
	manually segmented in parallel 1-mm cross sections. Quantitative
	3D models of the AV and root were generated and used to measure standard
	anatomic parameters and were compared to conventional two-dimensional
	echocardiographic measurements. All measurements are given as mean
	± SD.Annular, sinus, and sinotubular junction areas were 4.1 ± 0.6
	cm(2), 7.5 ± 1.2 cm(2), and 3.9 ± 1.0 cm(2), respectively. Root diameters
	(measured in three locations) by 3D model inspection and two-dimensional
	echocardiography measurement correlated (R(2) = 0.75). Noncoapted
	areas of the left, right, and noncoronary leaflets were 1.9 ± 0.2
	cm(2), 1.6 ± 0.3 cm(2), and 1.6 ± 0.3 cm(2), respectively. Mean coaptation
	areas for the left-right, left-noncoronary, and right-noncoronary
	coaptation zones were 87.7 ± 36.9 mm(2), 69.9 ± 20.7 mm(2), and 114.2
	± 23.0 mm(2), respectively. The mean ratio of noncoapted leaflet
	area to annular area was 1.3 ± 0.2.High-resolution 3D models of the
	in vivo normal human aortic root and valve were generated using 3D
	echocardiography. Quantitative 3D models and analysis may assist
	in characterization of pathology and decision making for AV repair.},

  abstract = {Huntington's disease is caused by a known genetic mutation and so
	potentially can be diagnosed many years before the onset of symptoms.
	Neuropathological changes have been found in both striatum and frontal
	cortex in the pre-symptomatic stage. Disruption of cortico-striatal
	white matter fibre tracts is therefore likely to contribute to the
	first clinical signs of the disease. We analysed diffusion tensor
	MR image (DTI) data from 25 pre-symptomatic gene carriers (PSCs)
	and 20 matched controls using a multivariate support vector machine
	to identify patterns of changes in fractional anisotropy (FA). In
	addition, we performed probabilistic fibre tracking to detect changes
	in 'streamlines' connecting frontal cortex to striatum. We found
	a pattern of structural brain changes that includes putamen bilaterally
	as well as anterior parts of the corpus callosum. This pattern was
	sufficiently specific to enable us to correctly classify 82\% of
	scans as coming from a PSC or control subject. Fibre tracking revealed
	a reduction of frontal cortico-fugal streamlines reaching the body
	of the caudate in PSCs compared to controls. In the left hemispheres
	of PSCs we found a negative correlation between years to estimated
	disease onset and streamlines from frontal cortex to body of caudate.
	A large proportion of the fibres to the caudate body originate from
	the frontal eye fields, which play an important role in the control
	of voluntary saccades. This type of saccade is specifically impaired
	in PSCs and is an early clinical sign of motor abnormalities. A correlation
	analysis in 14 PSCs revealed that subjects with greater impairment
	of voluntary-guided saccades had fewer fibre tracking streamlines
	connecting the frontal cortex and caudate body. Our findings suggest
	a specific patho-physiological basis for these symptoms by indicating
	selective vulnerability of the associated white matter tracts.},

	(superior sagittal sinus, femoral and jugular vein). At a typical

	oxygen saturation estimated via a closed-form cylinder approximation
	was 2.6\% hemoglobin oxygen saturation averaged over three locations

	(GME) in extracorporeal blood circuits based on the amplitude of
	backscattered ultrasound, starting with analytic modeling of the
	scattering behavior of GME in blood. After neglecting resonance effects,
	this model predicts a linear relationship between the amplitude of
	backscattered echoes and the diameter of GME. Computer simulations
	based on the cylindrical acoustic finite integration technique were
	performed to test some of the simplifying assumptions of the analytical
	model, with the simulations predicting small deviations from the
	linear approximation that could be treated as random scatter. Ultrasonic
	and microscopic measurements of injected GME were then performed
	on a test circuit to determine the linear correlation coefficient
	between echo amplitude and GME diameter in conditions like those
	employed in real cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuits. The correlation
	coefficient determined through this study was further validated in
	a closed-loop CPB circuit using canine blood. This study shows that
	the amplitude of ultrasonic backscattered echoes can be used to accurately
	estimate the size distribution of a population of detected GME when
	the spacing of emboli is great enough to minimize interference and
	other multi-path scattering effects. With the high flow rates found
	in CPB circuits, typically ranging from 2 to 6 L per minute (equivalent
	to a flow velocity of 0.3 to 1 m/s through the circuit tubing), this
	assumption will be valid even when hundreds of emboli per second
	pass through the circuit. Therefore, sizing of GME using the ultrasonic
	backscatter models described in this paper is a viable method for
	estimating embolic load delivered to a patient during a CPB procedure.},

  abstract = {Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is most commonly associated
	with TAR-DNA binding protein (TDP-43) or tau pathology at autopsy,
	but there are no in vivo biomarkers reliably discriminating between
	sporadic cases. As disease-modifying treatments emerge, it is critical
	to accurately identify underlying pathology in living patients so
	that they can be entered into appropriate etiology-directed clinical
	trials. Patients with tau inclusions (FTLD-TAU) appear to have relatively
	greater white matter (WM) disease at autopsy than those patients
	with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP). In this paper, we investigate the ability
	of white matter (WM) imaging to help discriminate between FTLD-TAU
	and FTLD-TDP during life using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).Patients
	with autopsy-confirmed disease or a genetic mutation consistent with
	FTLD-TDP or FTLD-TAU underwent multimodal T1 volumetric MRI and diffusion
	weighted imaging scans. We quantified cortical thickness in GM and
	fractional anisotropy (FA) in WM. We performed Eigenanatomy, a statistically
	robust dimensionality reduction algorithm, and used leave-one-out
	cross-validation to predict underlying pathology. Neuropathological
	assessment of GM and WM disease burden was performed in the autopsy-cases
	to confirm our findings of an ante-mortem GM and WM dissociation
	in the neuroimaging cohort.ROC curve analyses evaluated classification
	accuracy in individual patients and revealed 96\% sensitivity and
	100\% specificity for WM analyses. FTLD-TAU had significantly more
	WM degeneration and inclusion severity at autopsy relative to FTLD-TDP.These
	neuroimaging and neuropathological investigations provide converging
	evidence for greater WM burden associated with FTLD-TAU, and emphasise
	the role of WM neuroimaging for in vivo discrimination between FTLD-TAU
	and FTLD-TDP.},

	diameter-related indications for repair of saccular DTA are less

	(n = 17) DTAs who underwent computed tomographic angiography were
	identified. Patients with aneurysms related to connective tissue
	disease were excluded. The thoracic aorta was segmented, reconstructed,
	and triangulated to create a mesh. Finite element analysis was performed
	using a pressure load of 120 mm Hg and a uniform aortic wall thickness
	of 3.2 mm to compare the pressure-induced wall stress of fusiform
	and saccular DTAs.The mean maximum diameter of the fusiform DTAs
	(6.0 ± 1.5 cm) was significantly greater (p = 0.006) than that of
	the saccular DTAs (4.4 ± 1.8 cm). However, mean peak wall stress
	of the fusiform DTAs (0.33 ± 0.15 MPa) was equivalent to that of
	the saccular DTAs (0.30 ± 0.14 MPa), as found by using an equivalence
	threshold of 0.15 MPa. The mean normalized wall stress (peak wall

	greater than that of the fusiform DTAs (0.16 ± 0.09 MPa/cm vs. 0.11
	± 0.03 MPa/cm, p = 0.035).The normalized wall stress for saccular
	DTA is greater than that for fusiform DTA, indicating that geometric
	factors such as aneurysm shape influence wall stress. These results
	suggest that saccular aneurysms may be more prone to rupture than
	fusiform aneurysms of similar diameter, provide a theoretical rationale
	for the repair of saccular DTAs at a smaller diameter, and suggest

	biomarker for detection and monitoring of early Alzheimer's disease
	(AD), including during the amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI)
	stage. The pathology underlying AD has regionally selective effects
	within the hippocampus. As such, we predict that hippocampal subfields
	are more sensitive in discriminating prodromal AD (i.e., a-MCI) from
	cognitively normal controls than whole hippocampal volumes, and attempt
	to demonstrate this using a semi-automatic method that can accurately
	segment hippocampal subfields. High-resolution coronal-oblique T2-weighted
	images of the hippocampal formation were acquired in 45 subjects
	(28 controls and 17 a-MCI (mean age: 69.5 9.2; 70.2 7.6)). CA1, CA2,
	CA3, and CA4/DG subfields, along with head and tail regions, were
	segmented using an automatic algorithm. CA1 and CA4/DG segmentations
	were manually edited. Whole hippocampal volumes were obtained from
	the subjects' T1-weighted anatomical images. Automatic segmentation
	produced significant group differences in the following subfields:
	CA1 (left: p = 0.001, right: p = 0.038), CA4/DG (left: p = 0.002,
	right: p = 0.043), head (left: p = 0.018, right: p = 0.002), and
	tail (left: p = 0.019). After manual correction, differences were
	increased in CA1 (left: p < 0.001, right: p = 0.002), and reduced
	in CA4/DG (left: p = 0.029, right: p = 0.221). Whole hippocampal
	volumes significantly differed bilaterally (left: p = 0.028, right:
	p = 0.009). This pattern of atrophy in a-MCI is consistent with the
	topography of AD pathology observed in postmortem studies, and corrected
	left CA1 provided stronger discrimination than whole hippocampal
	volume (p = 0.03). These results suggest that semi-automatic segmentation
	of hippocampal subfields is efficient and may provide additional
	sensitivity beyond whole hippocampal volumes},

  abstract = {This study investigated the use of ultrasound image analysis in quantifying
	temperature changes in tissue, both ex vivo and in vivo, undergoing
	local hyperthermia.Temperature estimation is based on the thermal
	dependence of the acoustic speed in a heated medium. Because standard
	beam-forming algorithms on clinical ultrasound scanners assume a
	constant acoustic speed, temperature-induced changes in acoustic
	speed produce apparent scatterer displacements in B-mode images.
	A cross-correlation algorithm computes axial speckle pattern displacement
	in B-mode images of heated tissue, and a theoretically derived temperature-displacement
	relationship is used to generate maps of temperature changes within
	the tissue. Validation experiments were performed on excised tissue
	and in murine subjects, wherein low-intensity ultrasound was used
	to thermally treat tissue for several minutes. Diagnostic temperature
	estimation was performed using a linear array ultrasound transducer,
	while a fine-wire thermocouple invasively measured the temperature
	change.Pearson correlations ± SDs between the image-derived and thermocouple-measured
	temperature changes were R² = 0.923 ± 0.066 for 4 thermal treatments
	of excised bovine muscle tissue and R² = 0.917 ± 0.036 for 4 treatments
	of in vivo murine tumor tissue. The average differences between the
	two temperature measurements were 0.87°C ± 0.72°C for ex vivo studies
	and 0.97°C ± 0.55°C for in vivo studies. Maps of the temperature
	change distribution in tissue were generated for each experiment.This
	study demonstrates that velocimetric measurement on B-mode images
	has potential to assess temperature changes noninvasively in clinical
	applications.},

	was computed, and principal component analysis was used to evaluate
	variability in normal annular shape.The following mean ± standard
	deviations were obtained from 3D echocardiographic image analysis:
	annular circumference, 107.0 ± 14.6 mm; annular height, 7.6 ± 2.8
	mm; septolateral diameter, 28.5 ± 3.7 mm; intercommissural width,
	33.0 ± 5.3 mm; and annular height to intercommissural width ratio,
	22.7\% ± 6.9\%. Principal component analysis indicated that shape
	variability was primarily related to overall annular size, with more
	subtle variation in the skewness and height of the anterior annular
	peak, independent of annular diameter.Patient-specific 3D echocardiographic-based
	modeling of the human mitral valve enables statistical analysis of
	physiologically normal mitral annular geometry. The tool can potentially
	lead to the development of a new generation of annuloplasty rings

	of mitral regurgitation (MR). Toward this goal, the authors have
	developed a user-initialized algorithm for reconstructing valve geometry
	from transesophageal 3D ultrasound (3D US) image data.Semi-automated
	image analysis was performed on transesophageal 3D US images obtained
	from 14 subjects with MR ranging from trace to severe. Image analysis
	of the mitral valve at midsystole had two stages: user-initialized
	segmentation and 3D deformable modeling with continuous medial representation
	(cm-rep). Semi-automated segmentation began with user-identification
	of valve location in 2D projection images generated from 3D US data.
	The mitral leaflets were then automatically segmented in 3D using
	the level set method. Second, a bileaflet deformable medial model
	was fitted to the binary valve segmentation by Bayesian optimization.
	The resulting cm-rep provided a visual reconstruction of the mitral
	valve, from which localized measurements of valve morphology were
	automatically derived. The features extracted from the fitted cm-rep
	included annular area, annular circumference, annular height, intercommissural
	width, septolateral length, total tenting volume, and percent anterior
	tenting volume. These measurements were compared to those obtained
	by expert manual tracing. Regurgitant orifice area (ROA) measurements
	were compared to qualitative assessments of MR severity. The accuracy
	of valve shape representation with cm-rep was evaluated in terms
	of the Dice overlap between the fitted cm-rep and its target segmentation.The
	morphological features and anatomic ROA derived from semi-automated
	image analysis were consistent with manual tracing of 3D US image
	data and with qualitative assessments of MR severity made on clinical
	radiology. The fitted cm-reps accurately captured valve shape and
	demonstrated patient-specific differences in valve morphology among
	subjects with varying degrees of MR severity. Minimal variation in
	the Dice overlap and morphological measurements was observed when
	different cm-rep templates were used to initialize model fitting.This
	study demonstrates the use of deformable medial modeling for semi-automated

  abstract = {Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging is widely used to study
	the structure of the fiber pathways of brain white matter. However,
	the diffusion tensor cannot capture complex intravoxel fiber architecture
	such as fiber crossings of bifurcations. Consequently, a number of
	methods have been proposed to recover intravoxel fiber bundle orientations
	from high angular resolution diffusion imaging scans, optimized to
	resolve fiber crossings. It is important to improve the brain tractography
	by applying these multifiber methods to diffusion tensor protocols
	with a clinical b- value (low), which are optimized on computing
	tensor scalar statistics. In order to characterize the variance among
	different methods, consequently to be able to select the most appropriate
	one for a particular application, it is desirable to compare them
	under identical experimental conditions.In this work, the authors
	study how QBall, spherical deconvolution, persistent angular structure,
	stick and ball, diffusion basis functions, and analytical QBall methods
	perform under clinically-realistic scanning conditions, where the
	b-value is typically lower (around 1000 s∕mm(2)), and the number
	of diffusion encoding orientations is fewer (30-60) than in dedicated
	high angular resolution diffusion imaging scans. To characterize
	the performance of the methods, they consider the accuracy of the
	estimated number of fibers, the relative contribution of each fiber
	population to the total magnetic resonance signal, and the recovered
	orientation error for each fiber bundle. To this aim, they use four
	different sources of data: synthetic data from Gaussian mixture model,
	cylinder restricted model, and in vivo data from two different acquisition
	schemes.Results of their experiments indicate that: (a) it is feasible
	to apply only a subset of these methods to clinical data sets and
	(b) it allows one to characterize the performance of each method.
	In particular, two methods are not feasible to the kind of magnetic
	resonance diffusion data they test. By the characterization of their
	systematic behavior, among other conclusions, they report the method
	which better performs for the estimation of the number of diffusion
	peaks per voxel, also the method which better estimates the diffusion
	orientation.The framework they propose for comparison allows one
	to effectively characterize and compare the performance of the most
	frequently used multifiber algorithms under realistic medical settings
	and realistic signal-to-noise ratio environments. The framework is
	based on several crossings with a non-orientational bias and different
	signal models. The results they present are relevant for medical
	doctors and researchers, interested in the use of the multifiber
	solution for tractography.},

  abstract = {Brain atrophy is a relevant surrogate marker of the disease process
	in multiple sclerosis (MS) because it represents the net effect of
	various pathological processes leading to brain tissue loss. There
	are various approaches to quantifying central nervous system atrophy
	in MS. We have focused on a normalized measure of whole brain atrophy,
	the brain parenchymal fraction (BPF). BPF is defined as the brain
	parenchymal volume, divided by the volume within the surface of the
	brain. We applied this method to an MRI data set generated during
	a phase III clinical trial of interferon beta-1a (AVONEX). The purpose
	of the current study is to further explore clinical and MRI correlates
	of the BPF, particularly as they relate to relapse rate and Kurtzke's
	Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS); and to further explore the
	therapeutic effects observed in interferon beta-1a recipients. Of
	all demographic and disease measures in the clinical trial data base,
	T2 lesion volume most closely correlated with BPF in cross sectional
	studies, and was the baseline factor most closely correlated with
	progressive brain atrophy in the subsequent 2 years. We also observed
	that change in T2 lesion volume was the disease measure most closely
	correlated with change in BPF during 2 years of observation. Of interest,
	relapse number and EDSS change during 2 years were only weakly correlated
	with BPF change during the same period. Disability progression, defined
	as sustained worsening of at least 1.0 EDSS points from baseline,
	persisting at least 6 months, was associated with significantly greater
	brain atrophy progression. We observed a therapeutic effect of interferon
	beta-1a in the second year of the clinical trial, and this beneficial
	effect was not accounted for by change in gadolinium enhanced lesion
	volume, or by corticosteroid medication within 40 days of the final
	MRI scan. The BPF is an informative surrogate marker for destructive
	pathological processes in relaping MS patients, and is useful in
	demonstrating treatment effects in controlled clinical trials. The
	significance of progressive brain atrophy during relapsing MS will
	be assessed by measuring clinical and MRI changes in prospective
	follow up studies.},

	spinal cords from normal adult rats and rats that received cervical
	lateral funiculotomies, disrupting the rubrospinal tract (RST). Vitrogen
	and fibroblasts were transplanted into the surgical lesion at time
	of injury in order to fill the cavity. At 10 weeks, animals were
	sacrificed; the spinal cords were dissected out and then imaged in
	a 9.4-Tesla magnet. DTI tractography demonstrated the disruption
	of the rubrospinal tract axons while indicating which axon tracts
	were preserved. Additionally, DTI imaging could identify the orientation
	of glial processes in the gray matter adjacent to the site of injury.
	In the injured animals, reactive astrocytes in adjacent gray matter
	appeared to orient themselves perpendicular to white matter tracts.
	In summary, DTI identified not only white matter disruption following
	injury, but could distinguish the orientation of the accompanying
	glial scar.},

  abstract = {Aortic wall thickness (AWT) is important for anatomic description

	noninvasive method for measuring AWT exists. We hypothesized that
	semiautomated image segmentation algorithms applied to computed tomography
	angiography (CTA) can accurately measure AWT.Aortic samples from
	10 patients undergoing open thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair were
	taken from sites of the proximal or distal anastomosis, or both,
	yielding 13 samples. Aortic specimens were fixed in formalin, embedded
	in paraffin, and sectioned. After staining with hematoxylin and eosin
	and Masson's trichrome, sections were digitally scanned and measured.
	Patients' preoperative CTA Digital Imaging and Communications in
	Medicine (DICOM; National Electrical Manufacturers Association, Rosslyn,
	Va) images were segmented into luminal, inner arterial, and outer
	arterial surfaces with custom algorithms using active contours, isoline
	contour detection, and texture analysis. AWT values derived from
	image data were compared with measurements of corresponding pathologic
	specimens.AWT determined by CTA averaged 2.33 ± 0.66 mm (range, 1.52-3.55 mm),
	and the AWT of pathologic specimens averaged 2.36 ± 0.75 mm (range,
	1.51-4.16 mm). The percentage difference between pathologic specimens
	and CTA-determined AWT was 9.5\% ± 4.1\% (range, 1.8\%-16.7\%). The
	correlation between image-based measurements and pathologic measurements
	was high (R = 0.935). The 95\% limits of agreement computed by Bland-Altman
	analysis fell within the range of -0.42 and 0.42 mm.Semiautomated
	analysis of CTA images can be used to accurately measure regional
	and patient-specific AWT, as validated using pathologic ex vivo human
	aortic specimens. Descriptions and reconstructions of aortic aneurysms
	that incorporate locally resolved wall thickness are feasible and

  abstract = {Recent discussions within the neuroimaging community have highlighted
	the problematic presence of selection bias in experimental design.
	Although initially centering on the selection of voxels during the
	course of fMRI studies, we demonstrate how this bias can potentially
	corrupt voxel-based analyses. For such studies, template-based registration
	plays a critical role in which a representative template serves as
	the normalized space for group alignment. A standard approach maps
	each subject's image to a representative template before performing
	statistical comparisons between different groups. We analytically
	demonstrate that in these scenarios the popular sum of squared difference
	(SSD) intensity metric, implicitly surrogating as a quantification
	of anatomical alignment, instead explicitly maximizes effect size-an
	experimental design flaw referred to as "circularity bias." We illustrate
	how this selection bias varies in strength with the similarity metric
	used during registration under the hypothesis that while SSD-related
	metrics, such as Demons, will manifest similar effects, other metrics
	which are not formulated based on absolute intensity differences
	will produce less of an effect. Consequently, given the variability
	in voxel-based analysis outcomes with similarity metric choice, we
	caution researchers specifically in the use of SSD and SSD-related
	measures where normalization and statistical analysis involve the
	same image set. Instead, we advocate a more cautious approach where
	normalization of the individual subject images to the reference space
	occurs through corresponding image sets which are independent of
	statistical testing. Alternatively, one can use similarity terms
	that are less sensitive to this bias. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. © 2012

	Papillary-annular distance was increased in the IMR group relative

  abstract = {We propose a simple but generally applicable approach to improving
	the accuracy of automatic image segmentation algorithms relative
	to manual segmentations. The ap- proach is based on the hypothesis
	that a large fraction of the errors produced by auto- matic segmentation
	are systematic, i.e., occur consistently from subject to subject,
	and serves as a wrapper method around a given host segmentation method.
	The wrapper method attempts to learn the intensity, spatial and contextual
	patterns associated with systematic segmentation errors produced
	by the host method on training data for which manual segmentations
	are available. The method then attempts to correct such errors in
	segmentations produced by the host method on new images. One practical
	use of the proposed wrapper method is to adapt existing segmentation
	tools, without explicit modification, to imaging data and segmentation
	protocols that are different from those on which the tools were trained
	and tuned. An open-source implementation of the proposed wrapper
	method is provided, and can be applied to a wide range of image segmentation
	problems. The wrapper method is evaluated with four host brain MRI
	segmentation methods: hippocampus segmentation using FreeSurfer (Fischl
	et al., 2002); hippocampus seg- mentation using multi-atlas label
	fusion (Artaechevarria et al., 2009); brain extraction using BET
	(Smith, 2002); and brain tissue segmentation using FAST (Zhang et
	al., 2001). The wrapper method generates 72\%, 14\%, 29\% and 21\%
	fewer erroneously segmented voxels than the respective host segmentation
	methods. In the hippocampus segmentation experiment with multi-atlas
	label fusion as the host method, the aver- age Dice overlap between
	reference segmentations and segmentations produced by the wrapper
	method is 0.908 for normal controls and 0.893 for patients with mild
	cognitive impairment. Average Dice overlaps of 0.964, 0.905 and 0.951
	are obtained for brain extraction, white matter segmentation and
	gray matter segmentation, respectively.},

  abstract = {Multi-atlas segmentation is an effective approach for automatically
	labeling objects of interest in biomedical images. In this approach,
	multiple expert-segmented example images, called \textbackslashemph\{atlases\},
	are registered to a target image, and deformed atlas segmentations
	are combined using \textbackslashemph\{label fusion\}. Among the
	proposed label fusion strategies, weighted voting with spatially
	varying weight distributions derived from atlas-target intensity
	similarity have been particularly successful. However, one limitation
	of these strategies is that the weights are computed independently
	for each atlas, without taking into account the fact that different
	atlases may produce similar label errors. To address this limitation,
	we propose a new solution for the label fusion problem, in which
	weighted voting is formulated in terms of minimizing the total expectation
	of labeling error, and in which pairwise dependency between atlases
	is explicitly modeled as the joint probability of two atlases making
	a segmentation error at a voxel. This probability is approximated
	using intensity similarity between a pair of atlases and the target
	image in the neighborhood of each voxel. We validate our method in
	two medical image segmentation problems: hippocampus segmentation
	and hippocampus subfield segmentation in magnetic resonance (MR)
	images. For both problems, we show consistent and significant improvement
	over label fusion strategies that assign atlas weights independently},

	AD patients had significantly smaller volumes than the CN. When examining

  abstract = {Measurement of brain change due to neurodegenerative disease and treatment
	is one of the fundamental tasks of neuroimaging. Deformation-based
	morphometry (DBM) has been long recognized as an effective and sensitive
	tool for estimating the change in the volume of brain regions over
	time. This paper demonstrates that a straightforward application
	of DBM to estimate the change in the volume of the hippocampus can
	result in substantial bias, i.e., an overestimation of the rate of
	change in hippocampal volume. In ADNI data, this bias is manifested
	as a non-zero intercept of the regression line fitted to the 6 and
	12 month rates of hippocampal atrophy. The bias is further confirmed
	by applying DBM to repeat scans of subjects acquired on the same
	day. This bias appears to be the result of asymmetry in the interpolation
	of baseline and followup images during longitudinal image registration.
	Correcting this asymmetry leads to bias-free atrophy estimation.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the construction of a computational anatomical
	atlas of the human hippocampus. The atlas is derived from high-resolution
	9.4 Tesla MRI of postmortem samples. The main subfields of the hippocampus
	(cornu ammonis fields CA1, CA2/3; the dentate gyrus; and the vestigial
	hippocampal sulcus) are labeled in the images manually using a combination
	of distinguishable image features and geometrical features. A synthetic
	average image is derived from the MRI of the samples using shape
	and intensity averaging in the diffeomorphic non-linear registration
	framework, and a consensus labeling of the template is generated.
	The agreement of the consensus labeling with manual labeling of each
	sample is measured, and the effect of aiding registration with landmarks
	and manually generated mask images is evaluated. The atlas is provided
	as an online resource with the aim of supporting subfield segmentation
	in emerging hippocampus imaging and image analysis techniques. An
	example application examining subfield-level hippocampal atrophy
	in temporal lobe epilepsy demonstrates the application of the atlas
	to in vivo studies.},

	resolution T2-weighted magnetic resonance images that can be acquired
	in the routine clinical setting with under 5min scan time. The method
	combines multi-atlas segmentation, similarity-weighted voting, and
	a novel learning-based bias correction technique to achieve excellent
	agreement with manual segmentation. Initial partitioning of MRI slices
	into hippocampal 'head', 'body' and 'tail' slices is the only input
	required from the user, necessitated by the nature of the underlying
	segmentation protocol. Dice overlap between manual and automatic
	segmentation is above 0.87 for the larger subfields, CA1 and dentate
	gyrus, and is competitive with the best results for whole-hippocampus
	segmentation in the literature. Intraclass correlation of volume
	measurements in CA1 and dentate gyrus is above 0.89. Overlap in smaller
	hippocampal subfields is lower in magnitude (0.54 for CA2, 0.62 for
	CA3, 0.77 for subiculum and 0.79 for entorhinal cortex) but comparable
	to overlap between manual segmentations by trained human raters.
	These results support the feasibility of subfield-specific hippocampal
	morphometry in clinical studies of memory and neurodegenerative disease.},
