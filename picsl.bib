  abstract = {Few studies have examined connected speech in demented and non-demented
	patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We assessed the speech production
	of 35 patients with Lewy body spectrum disorder (LBSD), including
	non-demented PD patients, patients with PD dementia (PDD), and patients
	with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), in a semi-structured narrative
	speech sample in order to characterize impairments of speech fluency
	and to determine the factors contributing to reduced speech fluency
	in these patients. Both demented and non-demented PD patients exhibited
	reduced speech fluency, characterized by reduced overall speech rate
	and long pauses between sentences. Reduced speech rate in LBSD correlated
	with measures of between-utterance pauses, executive functioning,
	and grammatical comprehension. Regression analyses related non-fluent
	speech, grammatical difficulty, and executive difficulty to atrophy
	in frontal brain regions. These findings indicate that multiple factors
	contribute to slowed speech in LBSD, and this is mediated in part
	by disease in frontal brain regions.},

  abstract = {Converging lines of evidence suggest an adverse effect of heavy cannabis
	use on adolescent brain development, particularly on the hippocampus.
	In this preliminary study, we compared hippocampal morphology in
	14 "treatment-seeking" adolescents (aged 18-20) with a history of
	prior heavy cannabis use (5.8 joints/day) after an average of 6.7
	months of drug abstinence, and 14 demographically matched normal
	controls. Participants underwent a high-resolution 3D MRI as well
	as cognitive testing including the California Verbal Learning Test
	(CVLT). Heavy-cannabis users showed significantly smaller volumes
	of the right (p < 0.04) and left (p < 0.02) hippocampus, but no significant
	differences in the amygdala region compared to controls. In controls,
	larger hippocampus volumes were observed to be significantly correlated
	with higher CVLT verbal learning and memory scores, but these relationships
	were not observed in cannabis users. In cannabis users, a smaller
	right hippocampus volume was correlated with a higher amount of cannabis
	use (r = -0.57, p < 0.03). These data support a hypothesis that heavy
	cannabis use may have an adverse effect on hippocampus development.
	These findings, after an average 6.7 month of supervised abstinence,
	lend support to a theory that cannabis use may impart long-term structural
	and functional damage. Alternatively, the observed hippocampal volumetric
	abnormalities may represent a risk factor for cannabis dependence.
	These data have potential significance for understanding the observed
	relationship between early cannabis exposure during adolescence and
	subsequent development of adult psychopathology reported in the literature
	for schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.},

	from the SST to the individual time-points and provides unbiased,

	correction, consistent longitudinal segmentation, cortical parcellation
	and cortical thickness estimation are all based on strong use of
	the subject-specific priors built from initial diffeomorphic mapping
	between the SST and optimal group template. We evaluate our approach
	with both test-retest data and with application to a driving biological
	problem. We use test-retest data to show that this approach produces
	(a) zero change when the retest data contains the same image content
	as the test data and (b) produces normally distributed, low variance
	estimates of thickness change centered at zero when test-retest data
	is collected near in time to test data. We also show that our approach--when

	reproducibility in the biomedical imaging sciences. Here, we report
	and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging
	Tools (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open
	source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image
	registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative
	morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for
	the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and
	deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We
	detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared
	intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise
	mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare
	their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted
	MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report
	evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the
	affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate
	that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction
	results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual
	information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic
	mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669±0.022).
	Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify
	the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our
	open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark
	parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study
	to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible

	Using a lexical decision task, we examined the processing of concepts

	that the angular gyrus was activated across all categories regardless
	of their modality-specific feature associations, consistent with
	a heteromodal account for the angular gyrus. Exploratory analyses
	suggested that categories with weighted sensory-motor features additionally
	recruited modality-specific association cortices. Furthermore, DTI
	tractography identified white matter tracts connecting these regions

	These findings are consistent with a distributed semantic network

  abstract = {Huntington's disease is caused by a known genetic mutation and so
	potentially can be diagnosed many years before the onset of symptoms.
	Neuropathological changes have been found in both striatum and frontal
	cortex in the pre-symptomatic stage. Disruption of cortico-striatal
	white matter fibre tracts is therefore likely to contribute to the
	first clinical signs of the disease. We analysed diffusion tensor
	MR image (DTI) data from 25 pre-symptomatic gene carriers (PSCs)
	and 20 matched controls using a multivariate support vector machine
	to identify patterns of changes in fractional anisotropy (FA). In
	addition, we performed probabilistic fibre tracking to detect changes
	in 'streamlines' connecting frontal cortex to striatum. We found
	a pattern of structural brain changes that includes putamen bilaterally
	as well as anterior parts of the corpus callosum. This pattern was
	sufficiently specific to enable us to correctly classify 82\% of
	scans as coming from a PSC or control subject. Fibre tracking revealed
	a reduction of frontal cortico-fugal streamlines reaching the body
	of the caudate in PSCs compared to controls. In the left hemispheres
	of PSCs we found a negative correlation between years to estimated
	disease onset and streamlines from frontal cortex to body of caudate.
	A large proportion of the fibres to the caudate body originate from
	the frontal eye fields, which play an important role in the control
	of voluntary saccades. This type of saccade is specifically impaired
	in PSCs and is an early clinical sign of motor abnormalities. A correlation
	analysis in 14 PSCs revealed that subjects with greater impairment
	of voluntary-guided saccades had fewer fibre tracking streamlines
	connecting the frontal cortex and caudate body. Our findings suggest
	a specific patho-physiological basis for these symptoms by indicating
	selective vulnerability of the associated white matter tracts.},

  abstract = {Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging is widely used to study
	the structure of the fiber pathways of brain white matter. However,
	the diffusion tensor cannot capture complex intravoxel fiber architecture
	such as fiber crossings of bifurcations. Consequently, a number of
	methods have been proposed to recover intravoxel fiber bundle orientations
	from high angular resolution diffusion imaging scans, optimized to
	resolve fiber crossings. It is important to improve the brain tractography
	by applying these multifiber methods to diffusion tensor protocols
	with a clinical b- value (low), which are optimized on computing
	tensor scalar statistics. In order to characterize the variance among
	different methods, consequently to be able to select the most appropriate
	one for a particular application, it is desirable to compare them
	under identical experimental conditions.In this work, the authors
	study how QBall, spherical deconvolution, persistent angular structure,
	stick and ball, diffusion basis functions, and analytical QBall methods
	perform under clinically-realistic scanning conditions, where the
	b-value is typically lower (around 1000 s∕mm(2)), and the number
	of diffusion encoding orientations is fewer (30-60) than in dedicated
	high angular resolution diffusion imaging scans. To characterize
	the performance of the methods, they consider the accuracy of the
	estimated number of fibers, the relative contribution of each fiber
	population to the total magnetic resonance signal, and the recovered
	orientation error for each fiber bundle. To this aim, they use four
	different sources of data: synthetic data from Gaussian mixture model,
	cylinder restricted model, and in vivo data from two different acquisition
	schemes.Results of their experiments indicate that: (a) it is feasible
	to apply only a subset of these methods to clinical data sets and
	(b) it allows one to characterize the performance of each method.
	In particular, two methods are not feasible to the kind of magnetic
	resonance diffusion data they test. By the characterization of their
	systematic behavior, among other conclusions, they report the method
	which better performs for the estimation of the number of diffusion
	peaks per voxel, also the method which better estimates the diffusion
	orientation.The framework they propose for comparison allows one
	to effectively characterize and compare the performance of the most
	frequently used multifiber algorithms under realistic medical settings
	and realistic signal-to-noise ratio environments. The framework is
	based on several crossings with a non-orientational bias and different
	signal models. The results they present are relevant for medical
	doctors and researchers, interested in the use of the multifiber
	solution for tractography.},

	in fibre-orientation estimates obtained from peaks in the PAS or
	QBall Orientation Distribution Function (ODF). The Bingham model
	captures anisotropy in the uncertainty, allowing the method to track
	through fanning and bending structures, which previous methods do
	not recover reliably. We devise a new calibration procedure to construct
	a mapping from peak shape to Bingham parameters. We test the accuracy
	of the calibration using a bootstrap experiment. Finally, we show
	that exploiting the peak shape in this way can provide improved PICo
	tractography results.},

  abstract = {The continuous medial representation (cm-rep) is an approach that
	makes it possible to model, normalize, and analyze anatomical structures
	on the basis of medial geometry. Having recently presented a partial
	differential equation (PDE)-based approach for 3-D cm-rep modeling
	[1], here we present an equivalent 2-D approach that involves solving
	an ordinary differential equation. This paper derives a closed form
	solution of this equation and shows how Pythagorean hodograph curves
	can be used to express the solution as a piecewise polynomial function,
	allowing efficient and robust medial modeling. The utility of the
	approach in medical image analysis is demonstrated by applying it
	to the problem of shape-based normalization of the midsagittal section
	of the corpus callosum. Using diffusion tensor tractography, we show
	that shape-based normalization aligns subregions of the corpus callosum,
	defined by connectivity, more accurately than normalization based
	on volumetric registration. Furthermore, shape-based normalization
	helps increase the statistical power of group analysis in an experiment
	where features derived from diffusion tensor tractography are compared
	between two cohorts. These results suggest that cm-rep is an appropriate
	tool for normalizing the corpus callosum in white matter studies.},

  abstract = {Recent discussions within the neuroimaging community have highlighted
	the problematic presence of selection bias in experimental design.
	Although initially centering on the selection of voxels during the
	course of fMRI studies, we demonstrate how this bias can potentially
	corrupt voxel-based analyses. For such studies, template-based registration
	plays a critical role in which a representative template serves as
	the normalized space for group alignment. A standard approach maps
	each subject's image to a representative template before performing
	statistical comparisons between different groups. We analytically
	demonstrate that in these scenarios the popular sum of squared difference
	(SSD) intensity metric, implicitly surrogating as a quantification
	of anatomical alignment, instead explicitly maximizes effect size-an
	experimental design flaw referred to as "circularity bias." We illustrate
	how this selection bias varies in strength with the similarity metric
	used during registration under the hypothesis that while SSD-related
	metrics, such as Demons, will manifest similar effects, other metrics
	which are not formulated based on absolute intensity differences
	will produce less of an effect. Consequently, given the variability
	in voxel-based analysis outcomes with similarity metric choice, we
	caution researchers specifically in the use of SSD and SSD-related
	measures where normalization and statistical analysis involve the
	same image set. Instead, we advocate a more cautious approach where
	normalization of the individual subject images to the reference space
	occurs through corresponding image sets which are independent of
	statistical testing. Alternatively, one can use similarity terms
	that are less sensitive to this bias. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. © 2012

	Toolkit of the National Institutes of Health. Performance assessment
